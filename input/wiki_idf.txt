anarchism is political philosophy that advocates self governed societies based on voluntary institutions these are often described as stateless societies although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non hierarchical or free associations anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful while opposition to the state is central anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations anarchism is usually considered far left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics anarchism does not offer fixed body of doctrine from single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as philosophy many types and traditions of anarchism exist not all of which are mutually exclusive anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications etymology and terminology the word anarchism is composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism themselves derived respectively from the greek anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix ἀν an without and archos leader ruler cf archon or arkhē authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix izein the first known use of this word was in various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists as maximilien robespierre did the hébertists although few shared many views of later anarchists there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid nineteenth century since the and beginning in france the term libertarianism has often been used as synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the in the united states though its use as synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism history origins woodcut from diggers document by william everard the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the th century bc among the works of taoist philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan zhuangzi philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist zhuangzi wrote petty thief is put in jail great brigand becomes ruler of nation diogenes of sinope and the cynics as well as their contemporary zeno of citium the founder of stoicism also introduced similar topics jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition georges lechartier wrote the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles in early islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is right for each individual within the islamic society the french renaissance political philosopher étienne de la boétie wrote in his most famous work the discourse on voluntary servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the th century in england the term anarchist first entered the english language in during the english civil war as term of abuse used by royalists against their roundhead opponents by the time of the french revolution some such as the enraged ones began to use the term positively in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic by the turn of the th century the english word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment particularly jean jacques rousseau arguments for the moral centrality of freedom as part of the political turmoil of the in the wake of the french revolution william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought according to peter kropotkin godwin was the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke william godwin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism he argued in political justice that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power rather he advocated for its replacement through process of peaceful evolution his aversion to the imposition of rules based society led him to denounce as manifestation of the people mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at mutually beneficial method of social organisation in each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement the french pierre joseph proudhon is regarded as the first self proclaimed anarchist label he adopted in his groundbreaking work what is property published in it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is liberty is the mother not the daughter of order in what is property proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propriété where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish he contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use however proudhon later added that property is liberty and argued that it was bulwark against state power his opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time the anarcho communist joseph déjacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian unlike proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature in the post hegelian philosopher max stirner published in germany the book the ego and its own which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism french anarchists active in the revolution included anselme bellegarrigue ernest coeurderoy joseph déjacque and proudhon himself first international and the paris commune anarchist mikhail bakunin opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of during which ten countries had experienced brief or long term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists liberals and nationalists along with anarchists to prevent further revolt in spain ramón de la sagra established the anarchist journal el porvenir in la coruña in which was inspired by proudhon ideas the catalan politician francesc pi margall became the principal translator of proudhon works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in while being the leader of the federal democratic republican party according to george woodcock these translations were to have profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after but before that time proudhonian ideas as interpreted by pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early according to the encyclopædia britannica during the spanish revolution of pi margall attempted to establish decentralised or cantonalist political system on proudhonian lines in the international workingmen association sometimes called the first international united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon blanquists philadelphes english trade unionists socialists and social democrats due to its links to active workers movements the international became significant organisation karl marx became leading figure in the international and member of its general council proudhon followers the mutualists opposed marx state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william batchelder greene had been members of the first international in following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom lpf russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international which had decided not to get involved with the lpf they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the of property at first the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in more revolutionary socialist direction subsequently the international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads mikhail bakunin characterised marx ideas as centralist and predicted that if marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against anarchist historian george woodcock reports the annual congress of the international had not taken place in owing to the outbreak of the paris commune and in the general council called only special conference in london one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy while technical excuse that they had split away from the fédération romande was used to avoid inviting bakunin swiss supporters thus only tiny minority of anarchists was present and the general council resolutions passed almost unanimously most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers in the conflict climaxed with final split between the two groups at the hague congress where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york in response the federalist sections formed their own international at the st imier congress adopting revolutionary anarchist programme the paris commune was government that briefly ruled paris from march more formally from march to may the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco prussian war anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune they included louise michel the reclus brothers and eugene varlin the latter murdered in the repression afterwards as for the reforms initiated by the commune such as the re opening of workplaces as co operatives anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised moreover the commune ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of proudhon on french radical ideas the commune vision of communal france based on federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes bakunin and proudhon ideas proudhon like bakunin had argued in favour of the implementation of the binding mandate in and for federation of communes thus both economically and politically the paris commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas george woodcock states that notable contribution to the activities of the commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions including the mutualists courbet longuet and vermorel the libertarian collectivists varlin malon and lefrangais and the bakuninists elie and elisée reclus and louise michel organised labour the anti authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the state with the free and spontaneous organization of labour in the federation of organized trades and labor unions of the united states and canada unanimously set may as the date by which the eight hour work day would become standard sympathetic engraving by walter crane of the executed anarchists of chicago after the haymarket affair which is generally considered the most significant event for the origin of international may day observances in response unions across the united states prepared general strike in support of the event on may fight broke out in chicago when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd the next day on may anarchists staged rally at chicago haymarket square bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer in the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other seven police officers and at least four workers were killed eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement four of the men were executed and fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution the incident became known as the haymarket affair and was setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day in second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight hour day was made the event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as result of the haymarket affair although it had initially been conceived as once off event by the following year the celebration of international workers day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker holiday in the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from different countries among which were important figures of the anarchist movement including errico malatesta pierre monatte luigi fabbri benoît broutchoux emma goldman rudolf rocker and christiaan cornelissen various themes were treated during the congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of social revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient he thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti worker the phenomenon of professional union officials malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it in the spanish workers federation was the first major anarcho syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain the most successful was the confederación nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in before the the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics attracting million members at one point and playing major role in the spanish civil war the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association federation of anarcho syndicalist trade unions founded in with delegates representing two million workers from countries in europe and latin america in latin america in particular the anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america and until the early most of the trade unions in mexico brazil peru chile and argentina were anarcho syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the spanish as revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to great extent responsible for this situation the largest and most militant of these organisations was the federación obrera regional argentina it grew quickly to membership of nearly quarter of million which dwarfed the rival unions propaganda of the deed and illegalism italian american anarchist luigi galleani whose followers known as galleanists carried out series of bombings and assassination attempts from to in what they saw as attacks on tyrants and enemies of the people some anarchists such as johann most advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda scholars such as beverly gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed however most himself once boasted that the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion most is best known for pamphlet published in the science of revolutionary warfare how to manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in new jersey by the people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides from onwards the russian counterparts of these anti syndicalist anarchist communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations illegalism as practice emerged and within it the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt france bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism however as soon as important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in le révolté that structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with few kilos of dynamite variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement the anarcho syndicalist fernand pelloutier argued in for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter state repression including the infamous french lois scélérates of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed in the first place to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression may have played role in these isolated acts the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the paris commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts numerous heads of state were assassinated between and by members of the anarchist movement including tsar alexander ii of russia president sadi carnot of france empress elisabeth of austria king umberto of italy president william mckinley of the united states king carlos of portugal and king george of greece mckinley assassin leon czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist emma goldman russian revolution and other uprisings of the nestor makhno with members of the anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution however following political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left wing opposition the conflict culminated in the kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine in the free territory they fought in the civil war against the whites grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for number of months expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were among those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising before they left russia both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia criticising the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised for them bakunin predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist marxist state would become new elite had proved all too true the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example and communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the general confederation of labour and industrial workers of the world iww left the organisations and joined the communist international the revolutionary wave of saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism in the german uprising known as the german revolution of which established the bavarian soviet republic the anarchists gustav landauer silvio gesell and erich mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures in the italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho syndicalist trade union unione sindacale italiana grew to members and the influence of the italian anarchist union members plus umanita nova its daily paper grew accordingly anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces in the mexican revolution the mexican liberal party was established and during the early it led series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in baja california with the leadership of anarcho communist ricardo flores magón in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism their manifesto called the organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft was supported platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations conflicts with european fascist regimes in the and the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchism conflict with the state italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and benito mussolini fascists italian anarchists played key role in the anti fascist organisation arditi del popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august the veteran italian anarchist luigi fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counter revolution in france where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the february riots anarchists divided over united front policy anarchists in france and italy were active in the resistance during world war ii in germany the anarchist erich mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of february within few hours after the reichstag fire in berlin joseph goebbels the nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those jewish subversives over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at sonnenburg brandenburg and finally oranienburg on february mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at oranienburg when finally on the night of july mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in latrine the next morning spanish revolution in spain the national anarcho syndicalist trade union cnt initially refused to join popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to right wing election victory in the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power months later conservative members of the military with the support of minority extreme right parties responded with an attempted coup causing the spanish civil war in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land however the anarchists were losing ground even before the fascist victory in in bitter struggle with the stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the republicans cause from the soviet union according to noam chomsky the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the spanish anarchists not just in catalonia the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere the communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists partially because stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with western countries against hitler that failed and stalin withdrew the support to the republic they even withdrew the spanish gold reserves the events known as the spanish revolution was workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily catalonia aragon andalusia and parts of levante much of spain economy was put under worker control and in anarchist strongholds like catalonia the figure was as high as but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence as the soviet allied party actively resisted attempts at enactment factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution which he claimed came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on vast scale than any other revolution in history spanish communist party led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists the prominent italian anarchist camillo berneri who volunteered to fight against francisco franco was killed instead in spain by gunmen associated with the spanish communist party the city of madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last non francoist mayor of the city the anarchist melchor rodríguez garcía post war years anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of italy and france the mexican anarchist federation was established in after the anarchist federation of the centre united with the anarchist federation of the federal district in the early the antifascist international solidarity and the federation of anarchist groups of cuba merged into the large national organisation asociación libertaria de cuba cuban libertarian association from to the bulgarian anarchist communist federation reemerged as part of factory and workplace committee movement but was repressed by the new communist regime in in france the fédération anarchiste and the trade union confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist federazione anarchica italiana was founded in italy korean anarchists formed the league of free social constructors in september and in the japanese anarchist federation was founded an international anarchist congress with delegates from across europe was held in paris in may after world war ii an appeal in the fraye arbeter shtime detailing the plight of german anarchists and called for americans to support them by february the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in germany was large scale operation the federation of libertarian socialists was founded in germany in and rudolf rocker wrote for its organ die freie gesellschaft which survived until in the uruguayan anarchist federation was founded in the anarcho communist federation of argentina renamed itself as the argentine libertarian federation the syndicalist workers federation swf was syndicalist group in active in post war britain and one of solidarity federation earliest predecessors it was formed in by members of the dissolved anarchist federation of britain afb unlike the afb which was influenced by anarcho syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself the swf decided to pursue more definitely syndicalist worker centred strategy from the outset anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as albert camus herbert read paul goodman dwight macdonald allen ginsberg george woodcock leopold kohr julian beck john cage and the french surrealist group led by andré breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the fédération anarchiste anarcho pacifism became influential in the anti nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the english anarchist member of campaign for nuclear disarmament alex comfort or the similar activism of the american catholic anarcho pacifists ammon hennacy and dorothy day anarcho pacifism became basis for critique of militarism on both sides of the cold war the resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in robert graham anarchism documentary history of libertarian ideas volume two the emergence of the new anarchism contemporary anarchism squat near parc güell overlooking barcelona since squatting was prominent part of the emergence of renewed anarchist movement from the counterculture of the and on the roof occupy and resist surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the and anarchism was influential in the counterculture of the and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts in in carrara italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in by the three existing european federations of france the fédération anarchiste the federazione anarchica italiana of italy and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgarian federation in french exile in the united kingdom in the this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of barcelona spain in denmark squatters occupied disused military base and declared the freetown christiania an autonomous haven in central copenhagen since the revival of anarchism in the mid th century number of new movements and schools of thought emerged although feminist tendencies have always been part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha feminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the anarchist anthropologist david graeber and anarchist historian andrej grubacic have posited rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and cultural critical ideas and who by the turn of the st century formed by far the majority of anarchists around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization wto group of eight and the world economic forum some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police these actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet significant event of this period was the confrontations at wto conference in seattle in according to anarchist scholar simon critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as powerful critique of the pseudo libertarianism of contemporary neo liberalism one might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socio economic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the west ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and that is so palpable locally and globally rojava is supporting efforts for workers to form cooperatives such as this sewing cooperative international anarchist federations in existence include the international of anarchist federations the international workers association and international libertarian solidarity the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain in the form of the confederación general del trabajo cgt and the cnt cgt membership was estimated at around for anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the democratic federation of northern syria dfns more commonly known as rojava de facto autonomous region in northern syria abdullah öcalan founding member of the kurdistan workers party pkk who is currently imprisoned in turkey is an iconic and popular figure in the dfns whose ideas shaped the region society and politics while in prison öcalan corresponded with and was influenced by murray bookchin an anarcho communist theorist and philosopher who developed communalism and libertarian municipalism modelled after bookchin ideas öcalan developed the theory of democratic confederalism in march he issued his declaration of democratic confederalism in kurdistan calling upon citizens to stop attacking the government and instead create municipal assemblies which he called democracy without the state anarchist schools of thought pierre joseph proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist mutualism and influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil recognising equality of entitlement in chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the th century and post classical anarchist schools those created since the mid th century and after beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought mutualism mutualism began in th century english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance for this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism blackwell encyclopaedia of political thought blackwell publishing proudhon first characterised his goal as third form of society the synthesis of communism and property social anarchism social anarchism calls for system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion it is the largest school of thought in anarchism social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid collectivist anarchism collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or form of such is revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised this was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production however was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism this position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively upholding the wages system collectivist anarchism arose with marxism but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of collectivist stateless society anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of post revolutionary transition to communist system of distribution according to need anarcho communism anarcho communism also known as anarchist communism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need russian theorist peter kropotkin was influential in the development of anarcho communism some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarcho communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom most anarcho communists view anarcho communism as way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society anarcho communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international the theoretical work of peter kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro and insurrectionary anti sections to date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the spanish revolution and the free territory during the russian revolution through the efforts and influence of the spanish anarchists during the spanish revolution within the spanish civil war starting in anarchist communism existed in most of aragon parts of the levante and andalusia as well as in the stronghold of anarchist catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war hitler mussolini communist party of spain repression backed by the soviet union as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the spanish republic itself during the russian revolution anarchists such as nestor makhno worked to create and defend through the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchist communism in the free territory of the ukraine from before being conquered by the bolsheviks in anarcho syndicalism anarcho syndicalist trade union cnt in bilbao basque country in anarcho syndicalism is branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement anarcho syndicalists view labour unions as potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with new society democratically self managed by workers the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are workers solidarity direct action and workers self management anarcho syndicalists believe that only direct action that is action concentrated on directly attaining goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing representative to government position will allow workers to liberate themselves moreover anarcho syndicalists believe that workers organisations the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of new society should be self managing they should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves rudolf rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho syndicalist movement he outlined view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his pamphlet anarcho syndicalism the international workers association is an international anarcho syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries the spanish cnt played and still plays major role in the spanish labour movement it was also an important force in the spanish civil war individualist anarchism individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems individualist anarchism is not single philosophy but it instead refers to group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict in william godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote political justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism godwin was philosophical anarchist and from rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw minimal state as present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good max stirner is usually considered prominent early individualist anarchist sketch by friedrich engels an influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the german max stirner stirner the ego and its own published in is founding text of the philosophy according to stirner the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for god state or morality to stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which stirner proposed as form of organisation in place of the state egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals egoism has inspired many interpretations of stirner philosophy it was re discovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and homosexual activist john henry mackay josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist and the four page weekly paper he edited during the peaceful revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster it is apparent that proudhonian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews william greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form henry david thoreau was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe thoreau was an american author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading he is best known for his books walden reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings as well as his essay civil disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state benjamin tucker later fused stirner egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication liberty from these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists and nudists see anarcho naturism freethought and anti clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france these authors and activists included oscar wilde emile armand han ryner henri zisly renzo novatore miguel gimenez igualada adolf brand and lev chernyi among others post classical anarchist schools of thought lawrence jarach left and john zerzan right two prominent contemporary anarchist authors zerzan is known as prominent voice within anarcho primitivism while jarach is noted advocate of post left anarchy anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches insurrectionary anarchism is revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises insurrection within anarchist practice it is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on political programme and periodic congresses instead insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack permanent class conflict and refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies green anarchism or eco anarchism is school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues with an important precedent in anarcho naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho primitivism and social ecology writing from green anarchist perspective john zerzan attributes the ills of today social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization while layla abdelrahim argues that the shift in human consciousness was also shift in human subsistence strategies whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby violence thus according to her civilization was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics language and literacy she claims are some of these technologies anarcha feminism also called anarchist feminism and anarcho feminism combines anarchism with feminism it generally views patriarchy as manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association anarcha feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the state in essence the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa susan brown claims that as anarchism is political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power it is inherently feminist anarcha feminism began with the late th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre anarcho pacifism is tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see non violence it developed mostly in the netherlands britain and the united states before and during the second world war christian anarchism is movement in political theology that combines anarchism and christianity its main proponents included leo tolstoy dorothy day ammon hennacy and jacques ellul religious anarchism refers to set of related anarchist ideologies that are inspired by the teachings of organized religions but many anarchists have traditionally been skeptical of and opposed to organized religion many different religions have served as inspiration for religious forms of anarchism most notably christianity as christian anarchists believe that biblical teachings give credence to anarchist philosophy non christian forms of religious anarchism include buddhist anarchism jewish anarchism and most recently neopaganism synthesis anarchism is form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the this form found as its main proponents the anarcho communists voline and sébastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations platformism is tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of dielo truda organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft the document was based on the experiences of russian anarchists in the october revolution which led eventually to the victory of the bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups the platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement failures during the russian revolution post left anarchy is recent current in anarchist thought that promotes critique of anarchism relationship to traditional left wing politics some post leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting critique of organisations and morality influenced by the work of max stirner and by the marxist situationist international post left anarchy is marked by focus on social insurrection and rejection of leftist social organisation post anarchism is theoretical move towards synthesis of classical anarchist theory and thought drawing from diverse ideas including post left anarchy postmodernism autonomism postcolonialism and the situationist international queer anarchism is form of socialism which suggests anarchism as solution to the issues faced by the lgbt community mainly homophobia transphobia and biphobia anarcho queer arose during the late th century based on the work of michel foucault the history of sexuality left wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly anti corporatist anti hierarchical pro labour positions and anti capitalism in economics and anti imperialism in foreign policy anarcho capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of self ownership in free market anarcho capitalism developed from radical anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism drawing from austrian school economics study of law and economics and public choice theory there is strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho capitalism cannot be considered part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalist forms anarcho transhumanism is recently new branch of anarchism that takes traditional and modern anarchism typically drawing from anarcho syndicalism left libertarianism or libertarian soclialism and combines it with transhumanism and post humanism it can be described as liberal democratic revolution at its core the idea that people are happiest when they have rational control over their lives reason science and technology provide one kind of control slowly freeing us from ignorance toil pain disease and limited lifespans aging some anarcho transhumanists might also follow technogaianism as well internal issues and debates consistent with anarchist values is controversial subject among anarchists anarchism is philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought and as such disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism communism collectivism syndicalism trade unionism and capitalism anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilisation technology within anarcho primitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others on tactical level while propaganda of the deed was tactic used by anarchists in the th century the nihilist movement some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence counter economics and anti state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society about the scope of an anarchist society some anarchists advocate global one while others do so by local ones the diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory topics of interest intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory free love french individualist anarchist emile armand propounded the virtues of free love in the parisian anarchist milieu of the early th century an important current within anarchism is free love free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to josiah warren and to experimental communities viewed sexual freedom as clear direct expression of an individual sovereignty free love particularly stressed women rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women see for example marriage laws and anti birth control measures the most important american free love journal was lucifer the lightbearer edited by moses harman and lois waisbrooker but also there existed ezra heywood and angela heywood the word free society as the firebrand as free society was major anarchist newspaper in the united states at the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries the publication advocated free love and women rights and critiqued comstockery censorship of sexual information also lazarus was an important american individualist anarchist who promoted free love in new york city greenwich village bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self realisation and pleasure for women and also men in the here and now they encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical edna st vincent millay and the lesbian anarchist margaret anderson were prominent among them discussion groups organised by the villagers were frequented by emma goldman among others magnus hirschfeld noted in that goldman has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights and especially for those deprived of their rights thus it came about that she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only american to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public before goldman heterosexual anarchist robert reitzel spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the in his detroit based german language journal der arme teufel english the poor devil in argentina anarcha feminist virginia bolten published the newspaper called english the woman voice which was published nine times in rosario between january and january and was revived briefly in in europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was emile armand he proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults he was also consistent proponent of polyamory in germany the stirnerists adolf brand and john henry mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality mujeres libres was an anarchist women organisation in spain that aimed to empower working class women it was founded in by lucía sánchez saornil mercedes comaposada and amparo poch gascón and had approximately members the organisation was based on the idea of double struggle for women liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel in order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists lucía sánchez saornil was main founder of the spanish anarcha feminist federation mujeres libres who was open about her lesbianism she was published in variety of literary journals while working under male pen name she was able to explore lesbian themes at time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to censorship and punishment more recently the british anarcho pacifist alex comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual the joy of sex the issue of free love has dedicated treatment in the work of french anarcho hedonist philosopher michel onfray in such works as théorie du corps amoureux pour une érotique solaire and invention du plaisir fragments cyréaniques libertarian education and freethought francesc ferrer guàrdia catalan anarchist pedagogue and free thinker for english anarchist william godwin education was the main means by which change would be achieved godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness for godwin education had to have respect for the child autonomy which precluded any form of coercion pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child own motivation and initiatives and concern about the child capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school in his political justice he criticises state sponsored schooling on account of its obvious alliance with national government early american anarchist josiah warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established max stirner wrote in long essay on education called the false principle of our education in which stirner names his educational principle personalist explaining that self understanding consists in hourly self creation education for him is to create free men sovereign characters by which he means eternal characters who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment in the united states freethought was basically anti christian anti clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters number of contributors to liberty anarchist publication were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism the individualist anarchist george macdonald was co editor of freethought and for time the truth seeker walker was co editor of lucifer the light bearer and many anarchists were ardent freethinkers reprints from freethought papers such as lucifer the light bearer freethought and the truth seeker appeared in liberty the church was viewed as common ally of the state and as repressive force in and of itself in catalan anarchist and free thinker francesc ferrer guàrdia established modern or progressive schools in barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church the schools stated goal was to educate the working class in rational secular and non coercive setting fiercely anti clerical ferrer believed in freedom in education education free from the authority of church and state murray bookchin wrote this period was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where anarchists exercised some degree of influence perhaps the best known effort in this field was francisco ferrer modern school escuela moderna project which exercised considerable influence on catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally la escuela moderna and ferrer ideas generally formed the inspiration for series of modern schools in the united states cuba south america and london the first of these was started in new york city in it also inspired the italian newspaper università popolare founded in russian christian anarchist leo tolstoy established school for peasant children on his estate tolstoy educational experiments were short lived due to harassment by the tsarist secret police tolstoy established conceptual difference between education and culture he thought that education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself education is culture under restraint culture is free education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary for him without compulsion education was transformed into culture more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child led activity replaces pedagogic approaches experiments in germany led to neill founding what became summerhill school in summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice however although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle approach in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of consumer society instead criticisms criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms

autism is developmental disorder characterized by troubles with social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior parents usually notice signs in the first two or three years of their child life these signs often develop gradually though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at normal pace and then worsen autism is caused by combination of genetic and environmental factors risk factors include certain infections during pregnancy such as rubella as well as valproic acid alcohol or cocaine use during pregnancy controversies surround other proposed environmental causes for example the vaccine hypotheses which have been disproven autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood in the dsm autism is included within the autism spectrum asds along with asperger syndrome which is less severe and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pdd nos early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self care social and communication skills although there is no known cure there have been cases of children who have recovered from the condition not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood though some are successful an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking cure and others believing autism should be accepted as difference and not treated as disorder globally autism is estimated to affect million people as of in the the number of people affected was estimated at per people worldwide in the developed countries about of children are diagnosed with asd more than doubling from in in in the united states it occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls the number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the partly due to changes in diagnostic practice the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved characteristics autism is highly variable disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows steady course without remission people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal or even superior in others overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form it is distinguished not by single symptom but by characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis autism individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits social development social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things three to five year old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to lower ability to define person own emotions children with high functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrums communication about third to half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver in the second and third years children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd for example they may look at pointing hand instead of the pointed at object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language in pair of studies high functioning children with autism aged performed equally well as and as adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends repetitive behavior young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in row autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scale revised rbs categorizes as follows stereotyped behaviors repetitive movements such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking compulsive behaviors time consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules such as placing objects in specific order checking things or hand washing sameness resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted ritualistic behavior unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or dressing ritual this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors restricted interests interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus such as preoccupation with single television program toy or game self injury behaviors such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging no single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors other symptoms girl with autism autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family an estimated to of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population sensory abnormalities are found in over of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements an estimated of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly diagnostic indicator selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur this does not appear to result in malnutrition although some children with autism also have symptoms there is lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different symptoms than usual studies report conflicting results and the relationship between problems and asd is unclear parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship however they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults causes it has long been presumed that there is common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism characteristic triad of symptoms however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur deletion duplication and inversion are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism autism has strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents studies of twins suggest that heritability is for autism and as high as for asd and siblings of those with autism are about times more likely to be autistic than the general population however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified typically autism cannot be traced to mendelian single gene mutation or to single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene most loci individually explain less than of cases of autism the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation such as deletions duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis hence substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as cause of autism some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development exposure to air pollution during pregnancy especially heavy metals and particulates may increase the risk of autism environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods infectious diseases solvents pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress some such as the mmr vaccine have been completely disproven parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of routine vaccination this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload vaccine preservative or the mmr vaccine for causing autism the latter theory was supported by litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children mechanism autism symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain how autism occurs is not well understood its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the linkages between brain structures and behaviors the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiology autism affects the amygdala cerebellum and many other parts of the brain unlike many other brain disorders such as parkinson autism does not have clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is few disorders caused by mutations converging on few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception this anomaly appears to start cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors just after birth the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood it is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism it seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following an excess of neurons that causes local in key brain regions disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation unbalanced excitatory inhibitory networks abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines for example by modulation of the neurexin neuroligin cell adhesion system or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic proteins disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy which may explain why the two conditions are associated the immune system is thought to play an important role in autism children with autism have been found by researchers to have inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro inflammatory cytokines and significant activation of microglia biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful depends on balanced immune response it is thought that activation of pregnant mother immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing disruption of brain development this is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism the relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood several have been investigated with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport the role of group metabotropic glutamate receptors mglur in the pathogenesis of fragile syndrome the most common identified genetic cause of autism has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than of cases the mirror neuron system mns theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autism core features of social impairment and communication difficulties the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action the mns may contribute to an individual understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in mns regions of individuals with asd delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with asperger syndrome and correlation between reduced mns activity and severity of the syndrome in children with asd however individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the mns and the mns theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve goal or object autistic individuals tend to use different areas of the brain yellow for movement task compared to control group blue asd related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks in autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network large scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the task positive network used in sustained attention and goal directed thinking in people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting disturbance of self referential thought the theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by high level neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of low level processes evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by brainwave study that suggested that adults with asd have local in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex other evidence suggests the is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is disorder of the association cortex from studies based on event related potentials transient changes to the brain electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found preference for nonsocial stimuli for example studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain processing of auditory signals in the genetic area relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with deletion syndrome research on autism schizophrenia relations for chromosome chromosome and chromosome are inconclusive functional connectivity studies have found both hypo and hyper connectivity in brains of people with autism hypo connectivity seems to dominate especially for and cortico cortical functional connectivity neuropsychology two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior the first category focuses on deficits in social cognition simon baron cohen empathizing systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize that is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents an extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing these theories are somewhat related to baron cohen earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others the theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the sally anne test for reasoning about others motivations and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis however most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other people basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing the executive functions such as working memory planning inhibition in his review kenworthy states that the claim of executive dysfunction as causal factor in autism is controversial however it is clear that executive dysfunction plays role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people related theory enhanced perceptual functioning focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals yet another monotropism posits that autism stems from different cognitive style tending to focus attention or processing resources intensely to the exclusion of other stimuli these theories map well from the theory of autism neither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autism rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful diagnosis diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism under the dsm autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities these deficits are present in early childhood typically before age three and lead to clinically significant functional impairment sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome intellectual disability or global developmental delay icd uses essentially the same definition several diagnostic instruments are available two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interview revised adi is semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders disco may also be used pediatrician commonly performs preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions pediatric is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and specific language impairment such as landau kleffner syndrome the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest genetic cause although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile testing genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome copy number variations as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism genetics metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than three year old to continue to do so few years later in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits girls are often diagnosed later than boys underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms classification autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pdd nos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for more specific disorder unlike with autism people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger syndrome and pdd nos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably asd in turn is subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact the manifestations of autism cover wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent developmentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism lfa mfa and hfa based on iq thresholds or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome hfa and non syndromal autism is unclear some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to loss of language or social skills as opposed to failure to make progress typically from to months of age the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is specific subtype or that there is continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior screening about half of parents of children with asd notice their child unusual behaviors by age months and about four fifths notice by age months according to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome no babbling by months no gesturing pointing waving etc by months no single words by months no two word spontaneous not just echolalic phrases by months any loss of any language or social skills at any age the united states preventive services task force in found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns the japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at and months using autism specific formal screening tests in contrast in the uk children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened it is not known which approach is more effective screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers chat the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year inventory initial data on chat and its predecessor the checklist for autism in toddlers chat on children aged months suggests that it is best used in clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives it may be more accurate to precede these tests with broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders screening tools designed for one culture norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for different culture although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features prevention while infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than of cases of autism vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases management three year old with autism points to fish in an aquarium as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive shared attention training on language development the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence in general higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child needs families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy however the development of evidence based interventions has advanced in recent years although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care social and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated available approaches include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focalize treatment on specific area of deficit there is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention eibi an early intervention model based on aba for to hours week for multiple years is an effective treatment for some children with asd two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis aba and developmental social pragmatic models dsp one interventional strategy utilizes parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at home parent implementation despite the recent development of parent training models these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies being evaluated as probable efficacious mode of treatment education educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children similarly teacher implemented intervention that utilizes an aba combined with developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be well established treatment in improving social communication skills in young children although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in gap between what report recommends and what education is provided it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is subject of current debate among educators and researchers medication many medications are used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics antipsychotics such as risperidone and aripiprazole have been found to be useful for treating irritability repetitive behavior and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits and people with autism may respond atypically there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd no known medication relieves autism core symptoms of social and communication impairments experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism alternative medicine although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing training availability and parent requests some alternative treatments may place the child at risk study found that compared to their peers autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein free diets in botched chelation therapy killed five year old child with autism there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism there is no good evidence that gluten free diet is of benefit in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors there is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions verbal communication and non verbal communication skills society and culture the emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism through this movement people hope to cause others to think of autism as difference instead of disease proponents of this movement wish to seek acceptance not cures there have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as world autism awareness day light it up blue autism sunday autistic pride day autreat and others there have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone life these organizations include autism speaks autism national committee autism society of america and many others social science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as culture transcultural comparisons and research on social movements media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism rain man film that won oscars including best picture depicts character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities while many autistics don have these special abilities there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields cost treatment is expensive indirect costs are more so for someone born in us study estimated an average lifetime cost of net present value in dollars inflation adjusted from estimate with about medical care extra education and other care and lost economic productivity publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for given child and unreimbursed out of pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems one us study found average loss of annual income in families of children with asd and related study found that asd is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment us states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance after childhood key treatment issues include residential care job training and placement sexuality social skills and estate planning prognosis there is no known cure children recover occasionally so that they lose their diagnosis of asd this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not it is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples of children with asd have ranged from to most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger though few have developed communication skills in later years see also nonverbal autism most children with autism lack social support meaningful relationships future employment opportunities or self determination although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age few high quality studies address long term prognosis some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife acquiring language before age six having an iq above and having marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood epidemiology reports of autism cases per children grew dramatically in the us from to it is unknown how much if any growth came from changes in rates of autism most recent reviews tend to estimate prevalence of per for autism and close to per for asd and per children in the united states for asd as of because of inadequate data these numbers may underestimate asd true rate globally autism affects an estimated million people as of while asperger syndrome affects further million in the nhs estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged years and over in the uk was rates of pdd nos has been estimated at per asperger syndrome at roughly per and childhood disintegrative disorder at per cdc most recent estimate is that out of every children or per has an asd as of the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the and early this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism true prevalence has increased evidence from cdc study now provides strong evidence that the prevalence is steadily rising in the united states for example by autism affected one in children significant increase from the reported incidence of one in children and from the prevalence in this increase suggests directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics boys are at higher risk for asd than girls the sex ratio averages and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to with intellectual disability and more than without several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed one theory is that females are underdiagnosed although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism several other conditions are common in children with autism they include genetic disorders about of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome and asd is associated with several genetic disorders intellectual disability the percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from to wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing intelligence of individuals on the autism spectrum in comparison for pdd nos the association with intellectual disability is much weaker and by definition the diagnosis of asperger excludes intellectual disability anxiety disorders are common among children with asd there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from to many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself or are hard to distinguish from asd symptoms epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder several metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population preempted diagnoses although the dsm iv rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism the full criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd tourette syndrome and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted sleep problems affect about two thirds of individuals with asd at some point in childhood these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis history portrait of victor of aveyron feral child caught in who displayed possible symptoms of autism few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named the table talk of martin luther compiled by his notetaker mathesius contains the story of year old boy who may have been severely autistic luther reportedly thought the boy was soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report the earliest well documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue as detailed in court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair marriage to gain blair inheritance the wild boy of aveyron feral child caught in showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia he derived it from the greek word autós αὐτός meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance clinical development and diagnoses leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in the word autism first took its modern sense in when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler terminology autistic psychopaths in lecture in german about child psychology asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as separate diagnosis until leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in report of children with striking behavioral similarities almost all the characteristics described in kanner first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger donald triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism he was diagnosed by kanner after being first examined in and was labeled as case triplett was noted for his savant abilities particularly being able to name musical notes played on piano and to mentally multiply numbers his father oliver described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns music notes letters of the alphabet and president pictures by the age of he had the ability to recite the rd psalm and memorized questions and answers from the presbyterian catechism he was also interested in creating musical chords kanner reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant response to refrigerator mothers starting in the late autism was established as separate syndrome terminology and distinction from schizophrenia as late as the mid there was little evidence of genetic role in autism while in it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions although the rise of parent organizations and the of childhood asd have affected how asd is viewed parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child autistic behavior is perceived negatively and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research it took until for the dsm iii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia in the dsm iii provided checklist for diagnosing autism in may the dsm was released updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders the grouping of disorders including pdd nos autism asperger syndrome rett syndrome and cdd has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders the two categories that exist are impaired social communication and or interaction and restricted and or repetitive behaviors the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them way to form online communities and work remotely sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being references external links
diffusely reflected sunlight relative to various surface conditions albedo meaning whiteness is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation received by an astronomical body planet like earth it is dimensionless and measured on scale from corresponding to black body that absorbs all incident radiation to corresponding to body that reflects all incident radiation surface albedo is defined as the ratio of irradiance reflected to the irradiance received by surface the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earth surface these factors vary with atmospheric composition geographic location and time see position of the sun while bi hemispherical reflectance is calculated for single angle of incidence for given position of the sun albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in given period the temporal resolution may range from seconds as obtained from flux measurements to daily monthly or annual averages unless given for specific wavelength spectral albedo albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface between and μm this spectrum includes visible light μm which explains why surfaces with low albedo appear dark trees absorb most radiation whereas surfaces with high albedo appear bright snow reflects most radiation albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and environmental management as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design leed program for sustainable rating of buildings the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere its planetary albedo is because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his work photometria terrestrial albedo sample albedos surface typicalalbedo fresh asphalt open ocean worn asphalt conifer forest summer to deciduous trees to bare soil green grass desert sand new concrete ocean ice fresh snow any albedo in visible light falls within range of about for fresh snow to about for charcoal one of the darkest substances deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of black body when seen from distance the ocean surface has low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are in an albedo range of to the average albedo of earth is about this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo earth surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for single direction by satellite not all directions mathematical model is used to translate sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf which describes how the reflectance of given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo earth average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about if earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about in contrast if the entire earth was covered by water so called aquaplanet the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost white sky and black sky albedo for land surfaces it has been shown that the albedo at particular solar zenith angle can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directional hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle and the bi hemispherical reflectance with being the proportion of direct radiation from given solar angle and being the proportion of diffuse illumination hence the actual albedo also called blue sky albedo can then be given as directional hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black sky albedo and bi hemispherical reflectance as white sky albedo these terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface astronomical albedo the albedos of planets satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises major part of the astronomical field of photometry for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids enceladus moon of saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system with of em radiation reflected another notable high albedo body is eris with an albedo of many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about typical comet nucleus has an albedo of such dark surface is thought to be indicative of primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around but it is strongly directional and non lambertian displaying also strong opposition effect although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected their values can differ significantly which is common source of confusion in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces the correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is where is the astronomical albedo is the diameter in kilometers and is the absolute magnitude examples of terrestrial albedo effects illumination although the albedo temperature effect is best known in colder whiter regions on earth the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year round illumination is greater the maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere varying between three and twelve degrees north the minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination insolation effects the intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation where areas such as the sahara desert which also have relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation tropical and sub tropical rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation because insolation plays such big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the earth this has been concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker being water or ground which is darker color and reflects less heat back into space this feedback loop results in reduced albedo effect climate and weather albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation planet absorbs the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weather albedo temperature feedback when an area albedo changes due to snowfall snow temperature feedback results layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area warm air mass the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow temperature feedback however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass or soil the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating snow snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as for freshly fallen snow to about for melting snow and as low as for dirty snow over antarctica snow albedo averages little more than if marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the ice albedo positive feedback just as fresh snow has higher albedo than does dirty snow the albedo of snow covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow when sea ice melts either due to rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above the snow covered surface is reduced and more surface of sea water is exposed so the rate of energy absorption increases the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts as with the preceding example of snowmelt the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of positive feedback both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important to the modern theory of global warming cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates because of this in order to reduce the error of energy estimates it is important to measure the albedo of snow covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying single value for albedo over broad regions small scale effects albedo works on smaller scale too in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing solar photovoltaic effects albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices for example the effects of spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon si and crystalline silicon si based compared to traditional spectral integrated albedo predictions research showed impacts of over more recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of commonly occurring surface materials both human made and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications trees because forests generally have low albedo the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause net cooling effect trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat as net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are to higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily deciduous trees have an albedo value of about to whereas coniferous trees have value of about to studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes siberia were neutral or perhaps warming water water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials the reflectivity of water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations see graph reflectivity of smooth water at refractive index at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in locally specular manner not diffusely the glint of light off water is commonplace effect of this at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs incident angle curve and locally increased average incident angle although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from minimum of near to maximum approaching on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies aerosol effects aerosols very fine particles droplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on earth radiative balance the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain as per the effects are aerosol direct effect aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming aerosol indirect effect aerosols modify the properties of clouds through subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect black carbon another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is with range to black carbon is bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo human activities human activities deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult other types of albedo single scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles it depends on properties of the material

greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for letter to represent the glottal stop the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english typographic variants different glyphs of the lowercase letter during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media there was also cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial typographic variants include double storey and single storey at the end of the roman empire th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain by the th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through combining of prior forms th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italic form also called script is used in most current handwriting and consists of circle and vertical stroke this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of small loop with an arc over it both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of text from the rest set in roman type there are some other cases aside from italic type where script also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin such as in the international phonetic alphabet use in writing systems px english in modern english orthography the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds the near open front unrounded vowel as in pad the open back unrounded vowel as in father which is closer to its original latin and greek sound the diphthong as in ace and major usually when is followed by one or occasionally two consonants and then another vowel letter this results from middle english lengthening followed by the great vowel shift the modified form of the above sound that occurs before as in square and mary the rounded vowel of water the shorter rounded vowel not present in general american in was and what schwa in many unstressed syllables as in about comma solar the double sequence does

to denote something or someone of better or more prestigious quality or status or the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students schoolwork grade for clean restaurants list celebrities

population is birmingham which has long been the most industrialized city the largest city by land area is huntsville the oldest city is mobile founded by french colonists in as the capital of french louisiana from the american civil war until world war ii alabama like many states in the southern suffered economic hardship in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture similar to other former slave states alabamian legislators employed jim crow laws to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against african americans from the end of the reconstruction era up until at least the despite the growth of major industries and urban centers white rural interests dominated the state legislature from to the during this time urban interests and african americans were markedly under represented following world war ii alabama grew as the state economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests the state economy in the st century is based on management automotive finance manufacturing aerospace mineral extraction healthcare education retail and technology etymology russell cave in jackson county charcoal from indigenous camp fires in the cave has been dated as early as to bc the european american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river in the alabama language the word for person of alabama lineage is albaamo or variously albaama or albàamo in different dialects the plural form is albaamaha the suggestion that alabama was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely the word spelling varies significantly among historical sources the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of garcilaso de la vega used alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in of the term as early as the french called the tribe the alibamon with french maps identifying the river as rivière des alibamons other spellings of the name have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu allibamou sources disagree on the word meaning some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants the state has numerous place names of native american origin however there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language an article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant here we rest this notion was popularized in the through the writings of alexander beaufort meek experts in the muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such translation history pre european settlement the moundville archaeological site in hale county it was occupied by native americans of the mississippian culture from to ad indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of european colonization trade with the northeastern tribes by the ohio river began during the burial mound period bc ad and continued until european contact the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from to ad with one of its major centers built at what is now the moundville archaeological site in moundville alabama this is the second largest complex of the classic middle mississippian era after cahokia in present day illinois which was the center of the culture analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex secc contrary to popular belief the secc appears to have no direct links to mesoamerican culture but developed independently the ceremonial complex represents major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood among the historical tribes of native american people living in present day alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee an iroquoian language people and the muskogean speaking alabama alibamu chickasaw choctaw creek and koasati while part of the same large language family the muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages european settlement with exploration in the th century the spanish were the first europeans to reach alabama the expedition of hernando de soto passed through mabila and other parts of the state in more than years later the french founded the region first european settlement at old mobile in the city was moved

the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to forces on april thomas bassett loyalist to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile he settled in the tombigbee district during the early the district boundaries were roughly limited to the area within few miles of the tombigbee river and included portions of what is today southern clarke county northernmost mobile county and most of washington county what is now the counties of baldwin and mobile became part of spanish west florida in part of the independent republic of west florida in and was finally added to the mississippi territory in most of what is now the northern two thirds of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period it was claimed by the province of georgia from onwards following the revolutionary war it remained part of georgia although heavily disputed map showing the formation of the mississippi and alabama territories with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands what is now the lower one third alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in the yazoo lands were added to the territory in following the yazoo land scandal spain kept claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the adams onís treaty officially ceded it to the united states in early th century before mississippi admission to statehood on december the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory the united states congress created the alabama territory on march st stephens now abandoned served as the territorial capital from to alabama was admitted as the nd state on december with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention from july to august delegates met to prepare the new state constitution huntsville served as temporary capital from to when the seat of government moved to cahaba in dallas county thornhill in greene county it is former black belt plantation cahaba now ghost town was the first permanent state capital from to alabama fever was underway when the state was admitted to the union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation part of the frontier in the and its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded the economy of the central black belt named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew mainly from slave labor the area also drew many poor disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers alabama had an estimated population of under people in but it increased to more than people by most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in william nichols it was built from to and was destroyed by fire in from to tuscaloosa served as alabama capital on january the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery the first legislative session in the new capital met in december new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia the first structure burned down in but was rebuilt on the same site in this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day it was designed by barachias holt of exeter maine civil war and reconstruction by the population had increased to people of which nearly half were enslaved african americans and were free people of color on january alabama declared its secession from the union after remaining an independent republic for few days it joined the confederate states of america the confederacy capital was initially at montgomery alabama was heavily involved in the american civil war although comparatively few battles were fought in the state alabama contributed about soldiers to the war effort union army troops occupying courthouse square in huntsville following its capture and occupation by federal forces in company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville alabama joined nathan bedford forrest battalion in hopkinsville kentucky the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coat tails this led to them being greeted with yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army alabama slaves were freed by the th amendment in alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may until its official restoration to the union in from to with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state alabama was represented in congress during this period by three african american congressmen jeremiah haralson benjamin turner and james rapier following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton during reconstruction state legislators ratified new state constitution in that created the state first public school system and expanded women rights legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans besides the short lived original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white league reconstruction in alabama ended in when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governor office through an election dominated by fraud and violence they wrote another constitution in and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools railroad passenger cars were segregated in after disfranchising most african americans and many poor whites in the constitution the alabama legislature passed more jim crow laws at the beginning of the th century to impose segregation in everyday life th century the developing skyline of birmingham in the new constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all african americans and native americans and tens of thousands of poor whites through making voter registration difficult requiring poll tax and literacy test the constitution required racial segregation of public schools by only african americans were registered in alabama although at least were literate this compared to more than african americans eligible to vote in the numbers dropped even more in later decades the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the jails were segregated in hospitals in toilets hotels and restaurants in and bus stop waiting rooms in while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their as well due mostly to the imposition of cumulative poll tax by whites constituted slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws whites vs african americans nearly all african americans had lost the ability to vote despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as well the former mount sinai school in rural autauga county completed in it was one of the rosenwald schools built in the state beginning in the first rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the th century as part of the great migration out of the south reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from to at the same time many rural people both white and african american migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the magic city by the birmingham was the th largest city in the united states and had more than of the state population heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late following lawsuit and court order beginning in the when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters the alabama legislature took several counter steps designed to disfranchise black voters the legislature passed and the voters ratified as these were mostly white voters state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants black citizens in mobile successfully challenged this amendment as violation of the fifteenth amendment the legislature also changed the boundaries of tuskegee to sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits the supreme court unanimously held that this racial gerrymandering violated the constitution in the alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between and more than people moved into the city to work for war related industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed manufacturing and service base despite massive population changes in the state from to the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas in addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside birmingham one result was that jefferson county containing birmingham industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently in the legislature study noted that because of rural domination minority of about per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in lowndes county alabama challenged the state legislature lack of redistricting for congressional seats in white crook judge frank johnson ordered the state to redistrict united states supreme court cases of baker carr and reynolds sims ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties as alabama had used for its senate in for the first time since the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been for more than years other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts african americans continued to press in the and to end and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges in the us supreme court ruled in brown board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply during the under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott freedom rides in and selma to montgomery marches these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of and voting rights act of by the congress legal segregation ended in the states in but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court according to the new york times by many of alabama african americans were living in alabama cities particularly birmingham and montgomery in addition the rural black belt called that for its soil that stretches across the middle of the state is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly african american these counties include dallas lowndes marengo and perry despite recommendations of alabama constitutional commission the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties there is very limited home rule but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county level functions and policies this both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues alabama has made some changes since the late th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation in the an omnibus redistricting case dillard crenshaw county challenged the at large voting for representative seats of alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards at large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at large jurisdictions as part of settlement of this case five alabama cities and counties including chilton county adopted system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi seat jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county in limited voting was first tested in conecuh county together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens geography general map of alabama alabama is the thirtieth largest state in the united states with of total area of the area is water

which was in turn acquired by san francisco based urs corporation in law and government state government state capitol building in montgomery completed in the foundational document for alabama government is the alabama constitution which was ratified in at almost amendments and words it is by some accounts the world longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the united states constitution there has been significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabama constitution critics argue that alabama constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature leaving practically no power in local hands most counties do not have home rule any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and frequently by state referendum one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism heflin torbert judicial building in montgomery it houses the supreme court of alabama alabama court of civil appeals and alabama court of criminal appeals alabama government is divided into three coequal branches the legislative branch is the alabama legislature bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives with members and the alabama senate with members the legislature is responsible for writing debating passing or defeating state legislation the republican party currently holds majority in both houses of the legislature the legislature has the power to override gubernatorial veto by simple majority most state legislatures require two thirds majority to override veto until the state elected state senators on geographic basis by county with one per county it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in as result urbanized areas were grossly it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either in reynolds sims the us supreme court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented further the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems at that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that urban areas and districts this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one third of the state budget but jefferson county received only th of state services in funding through the legislative delegations the alabama legislature kept control of county governments governor kay ivey is the current and second female governor of alabama she is the only republican female governor in the state history the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws it is headed by the governor of alabama other members of executive branch include the cabinet the attorney general of alabama the alabama secretary of state the alabama state treasurer and the state auditor of alabama the current governor of the state is republican kay ivey the office of lieutenant governor is currently vacant the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections statewide officials such as the governor lieutenant governor attorney general and other constitutional officers take office the following january the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases the state highest court is the supreme court of alabama alabama uses partisan elections to select judges since the judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican lyn stuart all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party there are two intermediate appellate courts the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals and four trial courts the circuit court trial court of general jurisdiction and the district probate and municipal courts some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country in some years it imposes more death sentences than does texas state which has population five times larger some of its cases have been highly controversial the supreme court has overturned convictions in death penalty cases it was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use death sentence in cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole lwop that were voted unanimously by juries this judicial authority was removed in april taxes alabama levies or percent personal income tax depending upon the amount earned and filing status taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax and can do so even if taking the standard deduction taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the federal insurance contributions act tax social security and medicare tax the state general sales tax rate is sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases for example the total sales tax rate in mobile is and there is an additional restaurant tax of which means that diner in mobile would pay an tax on meal sales and excise taxes in alabama account for of all state and local revenue compared with an average of about nationwide alabama is one of seven states that levy tax on food at the same rate as other goods and one of two states the other being neighboring mississippi which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low income families most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply lower tax rate alabama income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the united states alabama is the only state that levies income tax on family of four with income as low as which is barely one quarter of the federal poverty line alabama threshold is the lowest among the states and the district of columbia with income taxes the corporate income tax rate is currently the overall federal state and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least tax burdened state in the country property taxes are the lowest in the the current state constitution requires voter referendum to raise property taxes since alabama tax structure largely depends on consumer spending it is subject to high variable budget structure for example in alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as million county and local governments treemap of the popular vote by county presidential election alabama has counties each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission it also has limited executive authority in the county because of the constraints of the alabama constitution which centralizes power in the state legislature only seven counties jefferson lee mobile madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the alabama constitutional commission legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county united states supreme court decisions in baker carr required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census in order to implement the principle of one man one vote before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to under representation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties the rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution alabama constitution has been amended more than times and almost one third of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state meaning that the state government holds monopoly on the sale of alcohol the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state twenty five of the

pell city pell city politics during reconstruction following the american civil war alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope in the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the black vote through violence fraud and intimidation after coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents process completed in provisions of the constitution provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor whites by more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised to the total effects were greater on the black community as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law from through the the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and of certain areas as counties were the basis of election districts the result was rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three quarters of the century until series of federal court cases required redistricting in to meet equal representation alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the and during the civil rights movement when whites and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform governor george wallace the state only four term governor was controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation only after passage of the federal civil rights act of and voting rights act of did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights in many jurisdictions they continued to be excluded from representation by at large electoral systems which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single member districts that enable more diverse representation among county boards in the alabama legislature passed and republican governor bob riley signed resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact in symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol which housed congress of the confederate states of america in republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in years after nearly complete realignment of political parties who represent different visions in the st century as of december there are total of registered voters with active and the others inactive in the state elections state elections with the of blacks in the state became part of the solid south system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state for nearly years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election since the mid to late th century however there has been realignment among the two major political parties and white conservatives started shifting to the republican party in alabama majority white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal state and local office members of the nine seats on the supreme court of alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office until no republicans held any of the court seats in that general election the then incumbent chief justice ernest hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately votes to republican perry hooper sr hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court this ultimately led to collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench in the early st century republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education in republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in years the last remaining statewide democrat who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in only two republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction when republicans generally represented reconstruction government including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise the two gop lt governors were steve windom and kay ivey local elections many local offices county commissioners boards of education tax assessors tax collectors etc in the state are still held by democrats many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority republican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary although there are exceptions alabama county sheriffs are elected in partisan at large races and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts the current split is democrats republicans and one independent fayette however most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban suburban and heavily populated counties the state of alabama has one female sheriff in morgan county alabama and ten african american sheriffs federal elections

of his heels alluding to these legends the term achilles heel has come to mean point of weakness especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution etymology linear tablets attest to the personal name achilleus in the forms ki re and ki re we the latter being the dative of the former the name grew more popular even becoming common soon after the seventh century bc and was also turned into the female form ἀχιλλεία achilleía attested in attica in the fourth century bc ig ii² and in the form achillia on stele in halicarnassus as the name of female gladiator fighting an amazon achilles name can be analyzed as combination of distress pain sorrow grief and people soldiers nation resulting in proto form akhí lāu os he who has the people distressed or he whose people have distress the grief or distress of the people is theme raised numerous times in the iliad and frequently by achilles himself achilles role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of glory usually in war furthermore laós has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean corps of soldiers muster with this derivation the name obtains double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring distress to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership another etymology relates the name to proto indo european compound h₂eḱ pṓds sharp foot which first gave an illyrian āk pediós evolving through time into ākhpdeós and then akhiddeús the shift from dd to ll is then ascribed to the passing of the name into greek via pre greek source the first root part h₂eḱ sharp pointed also gave greek

comparable to the latin acupedius swift of foot compare also the latin word family of aciēs sharp edge or point battle line battle engagement acus needle pin bodkin and acuō to make pointed sharpen whet to exercise to arouse whence acute some topical epitheta of achilles in the iliad point to this swift footedness namely ποδάρκης δῖος ἀχιλλεὺς podárkēs dĩos achilleús swift footed divine achilles or even more frequently πόδας ὠκὺς ἀχιλλεύς pódas ōkús achilleús quick footed achilles some researchers deem the name loan word possibly from pre greek language achilles descent from the nereid thetis and similarity of his name with those of river deities such as acheron and achelous have led to speculations about him being an old water divinity see below worship robert beekes has suggested pre greek origin of the name based among other things on the coexistence of λλ and in epic language which may account for palatalized phoneme ly in the original language birth and early years chiron teaching achilles how to play the lyre roman fresco from herculaneum st century ad achilles was the son of the nereid thetis and of peleus the king of the myrmidons zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus the fore thinker warned zeus of prophecy originally uttered by themis goddess of divine law that thetis would bear son greater than his father for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed peleus peter paul rubens thetis dipping the infant achilles into the river styx museum boijmans van beuningen rotterdam there is tale which offers an alternative version of these events in the argonautica zeus sister and wife hera alludes to thetis chaste resistance to the advances of zeus pointing out that thetis was so loyal to hera marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods thetis although daughter of the sea god nereus was also brought up by hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal according to the achilleid written by statius in the st century ad and to non surviving previous sources when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx however he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his left heel see achilles heel achilles tendon it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier in another version of this story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in rage however none of the sources before statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability to the contrary in the iliad homer mentions achilles being wounded in book the paeonian hero asteropaeus son of pelagon challenged achilles by the river scamander he cast two spears at once one grazed achilles elbow drawing spurt of blood also in the fragmentary poems of the epic cycle in which we can find description of the hero death the cypria the little iliad by lesches of pyrrha the aithiopis and iliou persis by arctinus of miletus there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel in the later vase paintings presenting achilles death the arrow or in many cases arrows hit his body peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur on mount pelion to be reared thetis foretold that her son fate was either to gain glory and die young or to live long but uneventful life in obscurity achilles chose the former and decided to take part in the trojan war according to homer achilles grew up in phthia together with his companion patroclus according to photius the sixth book of the new history by ptolemy hephaestion reported that thetis burned in secret place the children she had by peleus but when she had achilles peleus noticed tore him from the flames with only burnt foot and confided him to the centaur chiron later chiron exhumed the body of the damysus who was the fastest of all the giants removed the ankle and incorporated it into achilles burnt foot hidden on skyros some post homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis or in some versions peleus hid the young man at the court of lycomedes king of skyros there achilles is disguised as girl and lives among lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name pyrrha the red haired girl with lycomedes daughter deidamia whom in the account of statius he rapes achilles there fathers son neoptolemus also called pyrrhus after his father possible alias according to this story odysseus learns from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid odysseus goes to skyros in the guise of peddler selling women clothes and jewelry and places shield and spear among his goods when achilles instantly takes up the spear odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the greek campaign in another version of the story odysseus arranges for trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women while the women flee in panic achilles prepares to defend the court thus giving his identity away achilles in the trojan war according to the iliad achilles arrived at troy with ships each carrying myrmidons he appointed five leaders each leader commanding myrmidons menesthius eudorus peisander phoenix and alcimedon achilles and agamemnon by gottlieb schick telephus when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal guided by the oracle he arrived at argos where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed troilus achilles slaying troilus red figure kylix signed by euphronios according to the cypria the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles wrath when the achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas sacked neighbouring cities like pedasus and lyrnessus where the greeks capture the queen briseis and killed tenes son of apollo as well as priam son troilus in the sanctuary of apollo thymbraios however the romance between troilus and chryseis described in geoffrey chaucer troilus and criseyde and in william shakespeare troilus and cressida is medieval invention in dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe as well as in older accounts troilus was young trojan prince the youngest of king priam and hecuba five legitimate sons or according other sources another son of apollo despite his youth he was one of the main trojan war leaders horse fighter or chariot fighter according to homer prophecies linked troilus fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him yet achilles struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altar omphalos of apollo thymbraios later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over ardent lovers embrace in this version of the myth achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of dead child mourned by his parents had troilus lived to adulthood the first vatican mythographer claimed troy would have been invincible achilles in the iliad achilles cedes briseis to agamemnon from the house of the tragic poet in pompeii fresco st century ad naples national archaeological museum homer iliad

πηληϊάδεω ἀχιλῆος οὐλομένην μυρί ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε ἔθηκεν sing goddess of the rage of peleus son achilles the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the achaeans the homeric epic only covers few weeks of the decade long war and does not narrate achilles death it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by agamemnon the commander of the achaean forces agamemnon has taken woman named chryseis as his slave her father chryses priest of apollo begs agamemnon to return her to him agamemnon refuses and apollo sends plague amongst the greeks the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him achilles does so and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father agamemnon consents but then commands that achilles battle prize briseis the daughter of briseus be brought to him to replace chryseis angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away and as he says later because he loves briseis with the urging of his mother thetis achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces at the same time burning with rage over agamemnon

greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle wearing achilles armour though achilles remains at his camp patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches but is killed by hector before he can lead proper assault on the city of troy after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus the son of nestor achilles grieves over his beloved companion death his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles she persuades hephaestus to make new armour for him in place of the armour that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector the new armour includes the shield of achilles described in great detail in the poem enraged over the death of patroclus achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus zeus himself takes note of achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself finally achilles finds his prey achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena in the form of hector favorite and dearest brother deiphobus persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face after hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable wanting to go down fighting he charges at achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses accepting his fate hector begs achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw such agonies

penthesilea queen of the amazons and daughter of ares arrives in troy priam hopes that she will defeat achilles after his temporary truce with priam achilles fights and kills the warrior queen only to grieve over her death later at first he was so distracted by her beauty he did not fight as intensely as usual once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her following the death of patroclus nestor son antilochus becomes achilles closest companion when memnon son of the dawn goddess eos and king of ethiopia slays antilochus achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield killing memnon consequently eos will not let the sun rise until zeus persuades her the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus except that memnon unlike hector was also the son of goddess many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliad description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis which was composed after the iliad possibly in the th century bc the aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors achilles death attic black figure lekythos bc from sicily staatliche munich the death of achilles as predicted by hector with his dying breath was brought about by paris with an arrow to the heel according to statius in some versions the god apollo guided paris arrow some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with poisoned arrow all of these versions deny paris any sort of valour owing to the common conception that paris was coward and not the man his brother hector was and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield his bones were mingled with those of patroclus and funeral games were held he was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses polyxena achilles asks priam for polyxena hand in marriage priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world greatest warrior but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles paris who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with divine arrow killing him in the odyssey agamemnon informs achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his mound at the hellespont while they are receiving the dead suitors in hades he claims they built massive burial mound on the beach of ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patroclus paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles in book of homer odyssey odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead but achilles then asks odysseus of his son exploits in the trojan war and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus heroic actions achilles is filled with satisfaction this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life according to some accounts he had married medea in life so that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica rd century bc achilles tending patroclus wounded by an arrow attic red figure kylix bc altes museum berlin achilles and patroclus the exact nature of achilles relationship with patroclus has been subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times in the iliad it appears to be the model of deep and loyal friendship homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus were lovers despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures in th century bc athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia in plato symposium the participants in dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were couple phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover but ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women the fate of achilles armour achilles and ajax playing the board game petteia black figure oinochoe bc capitoline museums rome achilles armour was the object of feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ajax the greater they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners who after considering both men decided odysseus was more deserving of the armour furious ajax cursed odysseus which earned the ire of athena athena temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades after while when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide odysseus eventually gave the armour to neoptolemus the son of achilles relic claimed to be achilles bronze headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis lycia port on the pamphylian gulf the city was visited in bc by alexander the great who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear however it was shown in the time of pausanias in the nd century ad achilles ajax and game of petteia numerous paintings on pottery have suggested tale not mentioned in the literary traditions at some point in the war achilles and ajax were playing board game petteia they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle the trojans attacked and reached the heroes who were saved only by an intervention of athena worship and heroic cult the tomb of achilles extant throughout antiquity in troad was venerated by thessalians but also by persian expeditionary forces as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla achilles cult was also to be found at other places on the island of astypalaea in the sporades in sparta which had sanctuary in elis and in achilles homeland thessaly as well as in the magna graecia cities of tarentum locri and croton accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero the spread and intensity of the hero veneration among the greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus today black sea appears to have been remarkable an archaic cult is attested for the milesian colony of olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea today identified with snake island ukrainian зміїний zmiinyi near kiliya ukraine early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea graffiti and inscribed clay disks these possibly being votive offerings from olbia the area of berezan island and the tauric chersonese attest the existence of heroic cult of achilles from the sixth century bc onwards the cult was still thriving in the third century ad when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an achilles pontárchēs ποντάρχης roughly lord of the sea or of the pontus euxinus who was invoked as protector of the city of olbia venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates hermes agoraeus or poseidon pliny the elder ad in his natural history mentions port of the achæi and an island of achilles famous for the tomb of that man portus achaeorum insula achillis tumulo eius viri clara situated somewhat nearby olbia and the dnieper bug estuary furthermore at roman miles from this island he places peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of sword obliquely called dromos achilleos ἀχιλλέως δρόμος achilléōs drómos the race course of achilles and considered the place of the hero exercise or of games instituted by him this last feature of pliny account is considered to be the iconic spit called today tendra or kosa tendra and kosa djarilgatch situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay but which is hardly roman miles km away from the dnieper bug estuary as pliny states to the race course he gives length of miles km whereas the spit measures km today thetis and the nereids mourning achilles corinthian black figure hydria bc louvre paris roman statue of man with the dead body of boy identified as achilles and troilus nd century ad naples national archaeological museum in the following chapter of his book pliny refers to the same island as achillea and introduces two further names for it leuce or macaron from greek νῆσος μακαρῶν island of the blest the present day measures he gives at this point seem to account for an identification of achillea or leuce with today snake island pliny contemporary pomponius mela ad tells that achilles was buried on an island named achillea situated between the borysthenes and the ister adding to the geographical confusion ruins of square temple measuring meters to side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly in on snake island second exploration in showed that the construction of lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple fifth century bc black glazed lekythos inscription found on the island in reads glaukos son of poseidon dedicated me to achilles lord of leuke in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc statue is dedicated to achilles lord of leuke by citizen of olbia while in further dedication the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island cult again suggesting its quality as place of supra regional hero veneration the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic aethiopis according to which after his untimely death thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to mythical λεύκη νῆσος leúkē nêsos white island already in the fifth century bc pindar had mentioned cult of achilles on bright island φαεννά νᾶσος phaenná nâsos of the black sea while in another of his works pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmus well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles μακαρῶν νῆσοι makárôn nêsoi or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in poem by alcaeus speaking of achilles lord of scythia and the opposition of north and south as evoked by achilles fight against the aethiopian prince memnon who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death the periplus of the euxine sea ad gives the following details the greek geographer dionysius periegetes who lived probably during the first century ad wrote that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour similarly others relate the island name to its white cliffs snakes or birds dwelling there pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame in this island there is also achilles temple and his statue leuce had also reputation as place of healing pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent lord of croton to be cured of chest wound ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles herodotus pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of town achílleion ἀχίλλειον built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc close to the hero presumed burial mound in the troad later attestations point to an achílleion in messenia according to stephanus byzantinus and an achílleios ἀχίλλειος in laconia nicolae densuşianu recognized connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta called chilia presumably from an older achileii though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea evokes modern rather than archaic sea law the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son neoptolemus alexander the great son of the epirote princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy in ad the roman emperor caracalla while on his way to war against parthia emulated alexander by holding games around achilles tumulus reception during antiquity achilles in greek tragedy the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce workable modern play the first part of the achilleis trilogy the myrmidons focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon only few lines survive today in plato symposium phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles play with achilles as the main character only few fragments survive towards the end of the th century bc more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama euripides refers to achilles in bitter or ironic tone in hecuba electra and iphigenia in aulis achilles in greek philosophy the philosopher zeno of elea centered one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swift footed achilles and tortoise by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to tortoise with head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible as student of the monist parmenides and member of the eleatic school zeno believed time and motion to be illusions achilles in roman and medieval literature the romans who traditionally traced their lineage to troy took highly negative view of achilles virgil refers to achilles as savage and merciless butcher of men while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children other writers such as catullus propertius and ovid represent second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on achilles erotic career this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in benoît de sainte maure roman de troie and guido delle colonne historia destructionis troiae which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the th century achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler leo the deacon not as hellene but as scythian while according to the byzantine author john malalas his army was made up of tribe previously known as myrmidons and later as bulgars

out against the expansion of slavery but lost the race to douglas in lincoln secured the republican party presidential nomination as moderate from swing state though most delegates originally favored other candidates though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the south he swept the north and was elected president in though there were attempts to bridge the differences between north and south ultimately lincoln victory prompted seven southern slave states to secede from the united states and form the confederate states of america before he moved into the white house troops refused to leave fort sumter fort located in charleston south carolina after the secession of the southern states the resulting confederate attack on fort sumter inspired the north to rally behind the union as the leader of the moderate faction of the republican party lincoln confronted radical republicans who demanded harsher treatment of the south war democrats who rallied large faction of former opponents into his camp anti war democrats called copperheads who despised him and irreconcilable secessionists who plotted his assassination lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other by carefully planned political patronage and by appealing to the american people with his powers of oratory his gettysburg address became an iconic endorsement of

after his father murder thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier working at odd jobs in kentucky and in tennessee before settling with members of his family in hardin county kentucky in the early lincoln mother nancy is widely assumed to have been the daughter of lucy hanks although no record of nancy hanks birth has ever been found according to william ensign lincoln book the ancestry of abraham lincoln nancy was the daughter of joseph hanks however the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock still another researcher adin baber claims that nancy hanks was the daughter of abraham hanks and sarah harper of virginia thomas lincoln and nancy hanks were married on june in washington county and moved to elizabethtown kentucky following their marriage they became the parents of three children sarah born on february abraham on february and another son thomas who died in infancy thomas lincoln bought or leased several farms in kentucky including the sinking spring farm where abraham was born however land title dispute soon forced the lincolns to move in the family moved north to knob creek farm where thomas acquired title to of land in claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm of the that thomas held in kentucky he lost all but of his land in court disputes over property titles frustrated over the lack of security provided by the kentucky title survey system in the courts thomas sold the remaining land he held in kentucky in and began planning move to indiana where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure in the family moved north across the ohio river to indiana free non slaveholding territory where they settled in an unbroken forest in hurricane township perry county their land in southern indiana became part of spencer county indiana when the county was established in the farm is preserved as part of the lincoln boyhood national memorial in lincoln noted that the family move to indiana was partly on account of slavery but mainly due to land title difficulties in kentucky during the family years in kentucky and indiana thomas lincoln worked as farmer cabinetmaker and carpenter he owned farms several town lots and livestock paid taxes sat on juries appraised estates served on country slave patrols and guarded prisoners thomas and nancy lincoln were also members of separate baptists church which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol dancing and slavery within year of the family arrival in indiana thomas claimed title to of indiana land despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained clear title to of land in what became known as the little pigeon creek community in spencer county prior to the family move to illinois in thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property young lincoln by alt statue of young lincoln sitting on stump holding book open on his lap several significant family events took place during lincoln youth in indiana on october nancy lincoln died of milk sickness leaving eleven year old sarah in charge of household that included her father nine year old abraham and dennis hanks nancy nineteen year old orphaned cousin on december lincoln father married sarah sally bush johnston widow from elizabethtown kentucky with three children of her own abraham became very close to his stepmother whom he referred to as mother those who knew lincoln as teenager later recalled him being very distraught over his sister sarah death on january while giving birth to stillborn son as youth lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life some of his neighbors and family members thought for time that he was lazy for all his reading scribbling writing ciphering writing poetry etc and must have done it to avoid manual labor his stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy physical labor but loved to read lincoln was largely self educated his formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than year however he was an avid reader and retained lifelong interest in learning family neighbors and schoolmates of lincoln youth recalled that he read and reread the king james bible aesop fables john bunyan the pilgrim progress daniel defoe robinson crusoe mason locke weems the life of washington and the autobiography of benjamin franklin among others as he grew into his teens lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household he also complied with the customary obligation of son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of twenty one abraham became adept at using an axe tall for his age lincoln was also strong and athletic he attained reputation for brawn and audacity after very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of group of ruffians known as the clary grove boys in early march partly out of fear of milk sickness outbreak along the ohio river several members of the extended lincoln family moved west to illinois non slaveholding state and settled in macon county west of decatur historians disagree on who initiated the move thomas lincoln had no obvious reason to leave indiana and one possibility is that other members of the family including dennis hanks might not have attained the stability and steady income that thomas lincoln had after the family relocated to illinois abraham became increasingly distant from his father in part because of his father lack of education but occasionally lent him money in as thomas and other members of the family prepared to move to new homestead in coles county illinois abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own traveling down the sangamon river he ended up in the village of new salem in sangamon county later that spring denton offutt new salem merchant hired lincoln and some friends to take goods by flatboat from new salem to new orleans via the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers after arriving in new orleans and witnessing slavery firsthand lincoln returned to new salem where he remained for the next six years marriage and children according to some sources lincoln first romantic interest was ann rutledge whom he met

mary owens from kentucky when she was visiting her sister late in lincoln agreed to match with mary if she returned to new salem mary did return in november and lincoln courted her for time however they both had second thoughts about their relationship on august lincoln wrote mary letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship she never replied and the courtship ended in lincoln became engaged to mary todd who was from wealthy slave holding family in lexington kentucky they met in springfield illinois in december and were engaged the following december wedding set for

the stresses of losing her husband and sons and robert lincoln committed her temporarily to mental health asylum in abraham lincoln suffered from melancholy condition which now is referred to as clinical depression lincoln father in law and others of the todd family were either slave owners or slave traders lincoln was close to the todds and he and his family occasionally visited the todd

lincoln tastes which included particularly imported oysters early career and militia service lincoln depicted protecting native american from his own men in scene often related about lincoln service during the black hawk war in at age lincoln and partner bought small general store on credit in new salem illinois although the economy was booming in the region the business struggled and lincoln eventually sold his share that march he began his political career with his first campaign for the illinois general assembly he had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as natural raconteur in new salem though he lacked an education powerful friends and money which may be why he lost he advocated navigational improvements on the sangamon river before the election lincoln served as captain in the illinois militia during the black hawk war following his return lincoln continued his campaign for the august election for the illinois general assembly at he was tall and strong enough to intimidate any rival at his first speech when he saw supporter in the crowd being attacked lincoln grabbed the assailant by his neck and the seat of his trousers and threw him lincoln finished eighth out of candidates the top four were elected though he received of the votes cast in the new salem precinct lincoln served as new salem postmaster and later as county surveyor all the while reading voraciously he then decided to become lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading blackstone commentaries on the laws of england and other law books of his learning method lincoln stated studied with nobody his second campaign in was successful he won election to the state legislature though he ran as whig many democrats favored him over more powerful whig opponent admitted to the illinois bar in he moved to springfield illinois and began to practice law under john stuart mary todd cousin lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with reputation as formidable adversary during cross examinations and closing arguments he partnered with stephen logan from until then lincoln began his practice with william herndon whom lincoln thought studious young man successful on his second run for office lincoln served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as whig representative from sangamon county he supported the construction of the illinois and michigan canal which he remained involved with later as canal commissioner in the legislative session he voted to expand suffrage to white males whether landowners or not he was known for his free soil stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism he first articulated this in saying the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils his stance closely followed henry clay in supporting the american colonization society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in liberia in africa house of representatives lincoln in his late as member of the house of representatives photo taken by one of lincoln law students around from the early lincoln was steadfast whig and professed to friends in to be an old line whig disciple of henry clay the party including lincoln favored economic modernization in banking protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads and espoused urbanization as well lincoln ran for the whig nomination for illinois th district of the house of representatives in but was defeated by john hardin however lincoln won support for the principle of rotation whereby hardin would retire after only one term to allow for the nomination of another candidate lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in lincoln was indeed elected to the house of representatives in where he served one two year term he was the only whig in the illinois delegation but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line lincoln in collaboration with abolitionist congressman joshua giddings wrote bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners enforcement to capture fugitive slaves and popular vote on the matter he abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient whig supporters on foreign and military policy lincoln spoke out against the mexican american war which he attributed to president polk desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood lincoln also supported the wilmot proviso which if it had been adopted would have banned slavery in any territory won from mexico lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions the war had begun with mexican slaughter of american soldiers in territory disputed by mexico and the polk insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it the national papers ignored it and it resulted in loss of political support for lincoln in his district one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln lincoln later regretted some of his statements especially his attack on the presidential war making powers realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency lincoln who had pledged in to serve only one term in the house supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the presidential election taylor won and lincoln hoped to be appointed commissioner of the general land office but that lucrative patronage job went to an illinois rival justin butterfield considered by the administration to be highly skilled lawyer but in lincoln view an old fossil the administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the oregon territory this distant territory was democratic stronghold and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in illinois so he declined and resumed his law practice prairie lawyer lincoln in lincoln returned to practicing law in springfield handling every kind of business that could come before prairie lawyer twice year for years weeks at time he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation western expansion particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges as riverboat man lincoln initially favored those interests but ultimately represented whoever hired him in fact he later represented bridge company against riverboat company in landmark case involving canal boat that sank after hitting bridge in he received patent for flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water the idea was never commercialized but lincoln is the only president to hold patent in he represented the alton sangamon railroad in dispute with one of its shareholders james barret who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of barret pledge the charter was amended in the public interest to provide newer superior and less expensive route and the corporation retained the right to demand barret payment the decision by the illinois supreme court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in cases in as sole counsel of which were decided in his favor from to another of lincoln largest clients was the illinois central railroad lincoln reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname honest abe lincoln most notable criminal trial occurred in when he defended william duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker the case is famous for lincoln use of fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness after an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced farmers almanac showing the moon was at low angle drastically reducing visibility based on this evidence armstrong was acquitted lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom but in an case where he defended cousin peachy harrison who was accused of stabbing another to death lincoln angrily protested the judge decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as was expected the judge democrat reversed his ruling allowing the evidence and acquitting harrison republican politics emergence as republican leader his debates with stephen douglas over slavery the debate over the status of slavery in the territories exacerbated sectional tensions between the slave holding south and the north and the compromise of failed to defuse the issue in the early lincoln supported efforts for sectional mediation and his eulogy for henry clay focused on the latter support for gradual emancipation and opposition to both extremes on the slavery issue as the progressed the debate over slavery in the nebraska territory and kansas territory became particularly acrimonious and senator stephen douglas of illinois proposed popular sovereignty as compromise measure the proposal would take the issue of slavery out of the hands of congress by allowing the people of each territory to decide the status of slavery themselves the proposal alarmed many northerners who hoped to stop the spread of slavery into the territories despite this northern opposition douglas kansas nebraska act narrowly passed congress in may for months after its passage lincoln did not publicly comment on the kansas nebraska act but he came to strongly oppose it on october in his peoria speech lincoln declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency speaking in his kentucky accent with very powerful voice he said the kansas act had declared indifference but as must think covert real zeal for the spread of slavery cannot but hate it hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world lincoln attacks on the kansas nebraska act marked his return to political life nationally the whigs were irreparably split by the kansas nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue reflecting the demise of his party lincoln would write in think am whig but others say there are no whigs and that am an abolitionist do no more than oppose the extension of slavery drawing on the antislavery portion of the whig party and combining free soil liberty and antislavery democratic party members the new republican party formed as northern party dedicated to antislavery lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party fearing that it would serve as platform for extreme abolitionists lincoln also still hoped to rejuvenate the ailing whig party though he bemoaned his party growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement in the elections lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat in the aftermath of the elections which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the kansas nebraska act lincoln instead sought election to the united states senate at that time senators were elected by the state legislature after leading in the first six rounds of voting but unable to obtain majority lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull trumbull was an antislavery democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots his supporters also antislavery democrats had vowed not to support any whig lincoln decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbull antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate joel aldrich matteson in part due to the ongoing violent political confrontations in the kansas opposition to the kansas nebraska act remained strong in illinois and throughout the north as the elections approached lincoln abandoned the defunct whig party in favor of the republicans he attended the may bloomington convention which formally established the illinois republican party the convention platform asserted that congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of kansas as free state lincoln gave the final speech of the convention in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the union at the june republican national convention lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot though the party nominated ticket of john frémont and william dayton lincoln strongly supported the republican ticket campaigning for the party throughout illinois the democrats nominated former ambassador james buchanan who had been out of the country since and thus had avoided the debate over slavery in the territories while the know nothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore in the elections buchanan defeated both his challengers but frémont won several northern states and republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois though lincoln did not himself win office his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading republican in illinois portrait of dred scott lincoln denounced the supreme court decision in dred scott sandford as part of conspiracy to extend slavery eric foner contrasts the abolitionists and anti slavery radical republicans of the northeast who saw slavery as sin with the conservative republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress foner argues that lincoln was moderate in the middle opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the founding fathers especially the equality of all men and democratic self government as expressed in the declaration of independence in march the supreme court issued its decision in dred scott sandford the opinion by chief justice roger taney held that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories the decision sparked further outrage in the north lincoln denounced the decision alleging it was the product of conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power lincoln argued the authors of the declaration of independence never intended to say all were equal in color size intellect moral developments or social capacity but they did consider all men created equal equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness lincoln douglas debates and cooper union speech douglas was up for re election in and lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful illinois democrat with the former democrat trumbull now serving as republican senator many in the party felt that former whig should be nominated in and lincoln campaigning and willingness to support trumbull in had earned him favor in the party some eastern republicans favored the reelection of douglas for the senate in since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as slave state but many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference for the first time illinois republicans held convention to agree upon senate candidate and lincoln won the party senate nomination with little opposition accepting the nomination lincoln delivered his house divided speech drawing on mark house divided against itself cannot stand believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free do not expect the union to be dissolved do not expect the house to fall but do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north the stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the illinois legislature which would in turn select lincoln or douglas as its senator on being informed of lincoln nomination douglas stated lincoln is the strong man of the party and if beat him my victory will be hardly won the senate campaign featured the seven lincoln douglas debates of the most famous political debates in american history the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism and accused douglas of distorting the values of the founding fathers that all men are created equal while douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists the debates had an atmosphere of prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands lincoln stated douglas popular sovereignty theory was threat to the nation morality and that douglas represented conspiracy to extend slavery to free states douglas said that lincoln was defying the authority of the supreme court and the dred scott decision though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature re elected douglas to the senate despite the bitterness of the defeat for lincoln his articulation of the issues gave him national political reputation in may lincoln purchased the illinois staats anzeiger german language newspaper which was consistently supportive most of the state german americans voted democratic but there was republican support that german language paper could mobilize in the aftermath of the election newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as potential republican presidential candidate in with william seward salmon chase edward bates and simon cameron looming as rivals for the nomination while lincoln was popular in the midwest he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency in january lincoln told group of political allies that he would accept the presidential nomination if offered and in the following months several local papers endorsed lincoln for president on february new york party leaders invited lincoln to give speech at cooper union to group of powerful republicans lincoln argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the republicans required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong despite his inelegant appearance many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the republican presidential nomination journalist noah brooks reported no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to new york audience historian donald described the speech as superb political move for an unannounced candidate to appear in one rival seward own state at an event sponsored by the second rival chase loyalists while not mentioning either by name during its delivery in response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions lincoln said the taste is in my mouth little presidential nomination and campaign timothy cole wood engraving taken from may ambrotype of lincoln two days following his nomination for president on may the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur lincoln followers organized campaign team led by david davis norman judd leonard swett and jesse dubois and lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax lincoln supporters adopted the label of the rail candidate in lincoln described himself am in height six feet four inches nearly lean in flesh weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds dark complexion with coarse black hair and gray eyes on may at the republican national convention in chicago lincoln became the republican candidate on the third ballot beating candidates such as seward and chase former democrat hannibal hamlin of maine was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket lincoln success depended on his campaign team his reputation as moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff on the third ballot pennsylvania put him over the top pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs lincoln managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others while following lincoln strong dictate to make no contracts that bind me most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government with the dred scott decision and the presidency of james buchanan throughout the lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession meanwhile douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats delegates from slave states walked out of the democratic convention disagreeing with douglas position on popular sovereignty and ultimately selected incumbent vice president john breckinridge as their candidate group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee lincoln and douglas would compete for votes in the north while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south lincoln had highly effective campaign team who carefully projected his image as an ideal candidate as michael martinez says lincoln and his political advisers manipulated his image and background sometimes he appeared as straight shooting plain talking common sense wielding man of the people his image as the rail splitter dates from this era his supporters also portrayed him as honest abe the country fellow who was simply dressed and not especially polished or formal in his manner but who was as honest and trustworthy as his legs were long even lincoln tall gangly frame was used to good advantage during the campaign as many drawings and posters show the candidates sprinting past his vertically challenged rivals at other times lincoln appeared as sophisticated thoughtful articulate presidential candidate the rail candidate lincoln candidacy is depicted by crtitics as held up by the slavery issue slave on the left and party organization on the right prior to the republican convention the lincoln campaign began cultivating nationwide youth organization the wide awakes which it used to generate popular support for lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties as lincoln ideas of abolishing slavery grew so did his supporters people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln because of his ideas of anti slavery and took action to rally supporters for lincoln as douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches instead he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the republican party the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials there were thousands of republican speakers who focused first on the party platform and second on lincoln life story emphasizing his childhood poverty the goal was to demonstrate the superior power of free labor whereby common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts the republican party production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition chicago tribune writer produced pamphlet that detailed lincoln life and sold to copies presidency election and secession electoral votes shown in red put lincoln into the white house on november lincoln was elected the th president of the united states beating douglas breckinridge and bell he was the first president from the republican party his victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the north and west no ballots were cast for him in of the southern slave states and he won only two of counties in all the southern states lincoln received votes douglas votes breckinridge votes and bell votes turnout was percent with lincoln winning the free northern states as well as california and oregon douglas won missouri and split new jersey with lincoln bell won virginia tennessee and kentucky and breckinridge won the rest of the south although lincoln won only plurality of the popular vote his victory in the electoral college was decisive lincoln had and his opponents added together had only there were fusion tickets in which all of lincoln opponents combined to support the same slate of electors in new york new jersey and rhode island but even if the anti lincoln vote had been combined in every state lincoln still would have won majority in the electoral college the first photographic portrait of the new president as lincoln election became evident secessionists made clear their intent to leave the union before he took office the next march on december south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession by february florida mississippi alabama georgia louisiana and texas followed six of these states then adopted constitution and declared themselves to be sovereign nation the confederate states of america the upper south and border states delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to but initially rejected the secessionist appeal president buchanan and president elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy declaring secession illegal the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february there were attempts at compromise the crittenden compromise would have extended the missouri compromise line of dividing the territories into slave and free contrary to the republican party free soil platform lincoln rejected the idea saying will suffer death before consent to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have constitutional right lincoln however did tacitly support the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress before lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states that proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that congress would not interfere with slavery without southern consent few weeks before the war lincoln sent letter to every governor informing them congress had passed joint resolution to amend the constitution lincoln was open to the possibility of constitutional convention to make further amendments to the constitution capitol building the dome above the rotunda was still under construction en route to his inauguration by train lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north the president elect then evaded possible assassins in baltimore who were uncovered by lincoln head of security allan pinkerton on february he arrived in disguise in washington which was placed under substantial military guard lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no intention or inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature the failure of the peace conference of signaled that legislative compromise was impossible by march no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms meanwhile lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated lincoln said as the war was ending the civil war major anderson ft sumter commander the commander of fort sumter south carolina major robert anderson sent request for provisions to washington and the execution of lincoln order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war on april confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter forcing them to surrender beginning the war historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and not realizing the southern unionists were insisting there be no invasion william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on volcano and that the south was preparing for war historian david herbert donald concludes that his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood but he also vowed not to surrender the forts the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that on april lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states this call forced the states to choose sides virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the confederate capital despite the exposed position of richmond so close to union lines north carolina tennessee and arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland but did not prevail kentucky tried to be neutral the confederate attack on fort sumter rallied americans north of the mason dixon line to the defense of the american nation historian allan nevins says states sent union regiments south in response to lincoln call to save the capital and confront the rebellion on april mobs in baltimore which controlled the rail links attacked union troops who were changing trains and local leaders groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital the army responded by arresting local maryland officials lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach washington john merryman maryland official involved in hindering the troop movements petitioned supreme court chief justice and marylander roger taney author of the controversial pro slavery dred scott opinion to issue writ of habeas corpus and in june taney acting as circuit judge and not speaking for the supreme court issued the writ because in his opinion only congress could suspend the writ lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the ex parte merryman ruling union military strategy after the battle of fort sumter lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and forming an overall union military strategy to put down the rebellion lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis and he responded as commander in chief using unprecedented powers he expanded his war powers and imposed blockade on all the confederate shipping ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress and after suspending habeas corpus arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions in addition lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict running the machine an political cartoon satirizing lincoln administration featuring william fessenden edwin stanton william seward gideon welles lincoln and others the war effort was the source of continued disparagement of lincoln and dominated his time and attention from the start it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions in the union army copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue conversely the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery on august lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederate war effort in practice the law had little effect but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the confederacy in late august general john frémont the republican presidential nominee issued without consulting his superiors in washington proclamation of martial law in missouri he declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court martialed and shot and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed frémont was already under cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the department of the west compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption lincoln overruled frémont proclamation lincoln believed that fremont emancipation was political neither militarily necessary nor legal after lincoln acted union enlistments from maryland kentucky and missouri increased by over troops in foreign policy lincoln main goal was to stop military aid from countries abroad to the confederacy lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his secretary of state william seward at times seward was too bellicose so for balance lincoln maintained close working relationship with senator charles sumner the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee the trent affair of late threatened war with great britain the navy had illegally intercepted british mail ship the trent on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys britain protested vehemently while the cheered lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats biographer james randall has dissected lincoln successful techniques lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the war department headquarters he kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort consulted with governors and selected generals based on their past success as well as their state and party in january after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced simon cameron with edwin stanton as war secretary stanton centralized the war department activities auditing and cancelling contracts saving the federal government stanton was staunchly unionist pro business conservative democrat who moved toward the radical republican faction nevertheless he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together say thomas and hyman in terms of war strategy lincoln articulated two priorities to ensure that washington was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the north for prompt decisive victory major northern newspaper editors expected victory within days twice week lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon and occasionally mary lincoln would force him to take carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff general henry halleck disciple of the european strategist jomini he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy army rather than simply capturing territory general mcclellan after the union rout at bull run the first major battle of the civil war and the retirement of the aged winfield scott in late lincoln appointed major general george mcclellan general in chief of all the union armies mcclellan young west point graduate railroad executive and pennsylvania democrat took several months to plan and attempt his peninsula campaign longer than lincoln wanted the campaign objective was to capture richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the confederate capital mcclellan repeated delays frustrated lincoln and congress as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan troops in defense of the capital mcclellan who consistently overestimated the strength of confederate troops blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign george mcclellan after the battle of antietam in lincoln removed mcclellan as general in chief in march after mcclellan harrison landing letter in which he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort the office remained empty until july when henry halleck was selected for it mcclellan letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope republican as head of the new army of virginia pope complied with lincoln strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack however lacking requested reinforcements from mcclellan now commanding the army of the potomac pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for second time the war also expanded with naval operations in when the css virginia formerly the uss merrimack damaged or destroyed three union vessels in norfolk virginia before being engaged and damaged by the uss monitor lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the battle of hampton roads despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan failure to reinforce pope lincoln was desperate and restored him to command of all forces around washington to the dismay of all in his cabinet but seward two days after mcclellan return to command general robert lee forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam in september the ensuing union victory was among the bloodiest in american history but it enabled lincoln to announce that he would issue an emancipation proclamation in january having composed the proclamation some time earlier lincoln had waited for military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation mcclellan then resisted the president demand that he pursue lee retreating and exposed army while his counterpart general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee as result lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with republican ambrose burnside both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the commander in chief union soldiers before marye heights just prior to the second battle of fredericksburg on may burnside against the advice of the president prematurely launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was stunningly defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december not only had burnside been defeated on the battlefield but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined desertions during were in the thousands and they increased after fredericksburg lincoln brought in joseph hooker despite his record of loose talk about the need for military dictatorship the mid term elections in brought the republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver speedy end to the war as well as rising inflation new high taxes rumors of corruption the suspension of habeas corpus the military draft law and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market the emancipation proclamation announced in september gained votes for the republicans in the rural areas of new england and the upper midwest but it lost votes in the cities and the lower midwest while republicans were discouraged democrats were energized and did especially well in pennsylvania ohio indiana and new york the republicans did maintain their majorities in congress and in the major states except new york the cincinnati gazette contended that the voters were depressed by the interminable nature of this war as so far conducted and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress in the spring of lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if string of victories could be put together these plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond rosecrans on chattanooga grant on vicksburg and naval assault on charleston hooker was routed by lee at the battle of in may but continued to command his troops for some weeks he ignored lincoln order to divide his troops and possibly force lee to do the same in harper ferry and tendered his resignation which lincoln accepted he was replaced by george meade who followed lee into pennsylvania for the gettysburg campaign which was victory for the union though lee army avoided capture at the same time after initial setbacks grant laid siege to vicksburg and the union navy attained some success in charleston harbor after the battle of gettysburg lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his war secretary or his general in chief on to his generals who resented his civilian interference with their own plans even so he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as commander in chief emancipation proclamation first reading of the emancipation proclamation of president lincoln by francis bicknell carpenter alt dark haired bearded middle aged man holding documents is seated among seven other men lincoln understood that the federal government power to end slavery was limited by the constitution which before committed the issue to individual states he argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new territory at the beginning of the war he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it as envisioned by the founding fathers under the constitution president lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by major general john frémont in august and by major general david hunter in may on the grounds that it was not within their power and it would upset the border states loyal to the union on june endorsed by lincoln congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory in july the confiscation act of was passed which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion although lincoln believed it was not within congress power to free the slaves within the states he approved the bill in deference to the legislature he felt such action could only be taken by the commander in chief using war powers granted to the president by the constitution and lincoln was planning to take that action in that month lincoln discussed draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet in it he stated that as fit and necessary military measure on january all persons held as slaves in the confederate states will thenceforward and forever be free privately lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the confederacy had to be eliminated however copperheads argued that emancipation was stumbling block to peace and reunification republican editor horace greeley of the highly influential new york tribune fell for the ploy and lincoln refuted it directly in shrewd letter of august although he said he personally wished all men could be free lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the president he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his official duty was that of preserving the union the emancipation proclamation issued on september and put into effect on january declared free the slaves in states not then under union control with exemptions specified for areas already under union control in two states lincoln spent the next days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while democrats rallied their voters in the off year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became military objective as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in confederate territory were freed lincoln comment on the signing of the proclamation was never in my life felt more certain that was doing right than do in signing this paper for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such massive undertaking failed few days after emancipation was announced republican governors met at the war governors conference they supported the president proclamation but suggested the removal of general george mcclellan as commander of the union army enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the emancipation proclamation by the spring of lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers in letter to andrew johnson the military governor of tennessee encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops lincoln wrote the bare sight of armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once by the end of at lincoln direction general lorenzo thomas had recruited regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley frederick douglass once observed of lincoln in his company was never reminded of my humble origin or of my unpopular color gettysburg address the speech with the great union victory at the battle of gettysburg in july and the defeat of the copperheads in the ohio election in the fall lincoln maintained strong base of party support and was in strong position to redefine the war effort despite the new york city draft riots the stage was set for his address at the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november defying lincoln prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here the address became the most quoted speech in american history in words and three minutes lincoln asserted the nation was born not in but in conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal he defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all the emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end as result of the losses and the future of democracy in the world would be assured that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth lincoln concluded that the civil war had profound objective new birth of freedom in the nation general grant sherman and grant and admiral porter in the peacemakers an painting of events aboard the river queen in march meade failure to capture lee army as it retreated from gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln that change in command was needed general ulysses grant victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln and made grant strong candidate to head the union army responding to criticism of grant after shiloh lincoln had said can spare this man he fights with grant in command lincoln felt the union army could relentlessly pursue series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters and have top commander who agreed on the use of black troops nevertheless lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering candidacy for president in as mcclellan was lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into grant political intentions and being assured that he had none submitted to the senate grant promotion to commander of the union army he obtained congress consent to reinstate for grant the rank of lieutenant general which no officer had held since george washington grant waged his bloody overland campaign in this is often characterized as war of attrition given high union losses at battles such as the battle of the wilderness and cold harbor even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive the confederate forces had almost as high percentage of casualties as the union forces the high casualty figures of the union alarmed the north grant had lost third of his army and lincoln asked what grant plans were to which the general replied propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer the confederacy lacked reinforcements so lee army shrank with every costly battle grant army moved south crossed the james river forcing siege and trench warfare outside petersburg virginia lincoln then made an extended visit to grant headquarters at city point virginia this allowed the president to confer in person with grant and william tecumseh sherman about the hostilities as sherman coincidentally managed hasty visit to grant from his position in north carolina lincoln and the republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the north and replaced the union losses lincoln authorized grant to target the confederate infrastructure such as plantations railroads and bridges hoping to destroy the south morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting grant move to petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between richmond and the south this strategy allowed generals sherman and philip sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in virginia shenandoah valley the damage caused by sherman march to the sea through georgia in was limited to swath but neither lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal but rather defeat of the confederate armies mark neely jr has argued that there was no effort to engage in total war against civilians which he believed did take place during world war ii confederate general jubal early began series of assaults in the north that threatened the capital during early raid on washington in lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position captain oliver wendell holmes shouted at him get down you damn fool before you get shot after repeated calls on grant to defend washington sheridan was appointed and the threat from early was dispatched as grant continued to wear down lee forces efforts to discuss peace began confederate vice president stephens led group to meet with lincoln seward and others at hampton roads lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the confederacy as coequal his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results on april grant successfully outflanked lee forces in the battle of five forks and nearly encircled petersburg and the confederate government evacuated richmond days later when that city fell lincoln visited the vanquished confederate capital as he walked through the city white southerners were stone faced but freedmen greeted him as hero on april lee surrendered to grant at appomattox and the war was effectively over re election electoral landslide for lincoln in red in the election southern states brown and territories light brown not in play while the war was still being waged lincoln faced reelection in lincoln was master politician bringing together and holding together all the main factions of the republican party and bringing in war democrats such as edwin stanton and andrew johnson as well lincoln spent many hours week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers greatly expanded over peacetime to hold the factions of his party together build support for his own policies and fend off efforts by radicals to drop him from the ticket at its convention the republican party selected johnson war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans lincoln ran under the label of the new union party when grant spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and union casualties mounted the lack of military success wore heavily on the president re election prospects and many republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated sharing this fear lincoln wrote and signed pledge that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war failure their candidate general george mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform lincoln provided grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of grant in the war effort sherman capture of atlanta in september and david farragut capture of mobile ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln by contrast the national union party was united and energized as lincoln made emancipation the central issue and state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads on november lincoln was re elected in landslide carrying all but three states and receiving percent of the union soldiers vote lincoln second inaugural address in at the almost completed capitol building on march lincoln delivered his second inaugural address in it he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be god will historian mark noll concludes it ranks among the small handful of semi sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world lincoln said reconstruction reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states and how to determine the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves shortly after lee surrender general had asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated and lincoln replied let em up easy in keeping with that sentiment lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radical republicans under rep thaddeus stevens sen charles sumner and sen benjamin wade political allies of the president on other issues determined to find course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war his amnesty proclamation of december offered pardons to those who had not held confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance political cartoon of vice president andrew johnson former tailor and lincoln entitled the rail splitter at work repairing the union the caption reads johnson take it quietly uncle abe and will draw it closer than ever lincoln few more stitches andy and the good old union will be mended as southern states were subdued critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re formed of special importance were tennessee and arkansas where lincoln appointed generals andrew johnson and frederick steele as military governors respectively in louisiana lincoln ordered general nathaniel banks to promote plan that would restore statehood when percent of the voters agreed to it lincoln democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations on the other hand the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the wade davis bill in when lincoln vetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee lincoln appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and radical factions in harness to fill chief justice taney seat on the supreme court he named the choice of the radicals salmon chase who lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies after implementing the emancipation proclamation which did not apply to every state lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with constitutional amendment lincoln declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter by december proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to congress for passage this first attempt at an amendment failed to pass falling short of the required two thirds majority on june in the house of representatives passage of the proposed amendment became part of the republican unionist platform in the election of after long debate in the house second attempt passed congress on january and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification upon ratification it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december as the war drew to close lincoln presidential reconstruction for the south was in flux having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen he signed into law senator charles sumner freedmen bureau bill that set up temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves the law assigned land for lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen lincoln stated that his louisiana plan did not apply to all states under reconstruction shortly before his assassination lincoln announced he had new plan for southern reconstruction discussions with his cabinet revealed lincoln planned short term military control over southern states until readmission under the control of southern unionists historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what lincoln would have done about reconstruction if he had lived but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen lincoln biographers james randall and richard current according to david lincove argue that eric foner argues that redefining the republic and republicanism lincoln in february about two months before his death the successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural these united states and other times in the singular without any particular grammatical consistency the civil war was significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the th century in recent years historians such as harry jaffa herman belz john diggins vernon burton and eric foner have stressed lincoln redefinition of republican values as early as the time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln redirected emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political values what he called the sheet anchor of republicanism the declaration emphasis on freedom and equality for all in contrast to the constitution tolerance of slavery shifted the debate as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech of early lincoln presented americans theory of history that offers profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms nevertheless in lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was contract and for one party to get out of contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee republican form of government in every state burton argues that lincoln republicanism was taken up by the freedmen as they were emancipated in march in lincoln first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the american system he said majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of free people other enactments lincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency which gave congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the executive enforced them lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by congress the only important one was the wade davis bill with its harsh program of reconstruction he signed the homestead act in making millions of acres of government held land in the west available for purchase at very low cost the morrill land grant colleges act also signed in provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state the pacific railway acts of and granted federal support for the construction of the united states first railroad which was completed in the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was made possible by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs policy with long precedent and new federal income tax in lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariff the first having become law under james buchanan also in lincoln signed the revenue act of creating the first income tax this created flat tax of percent on incomes above in current dollar terms which was later changed by the revenue act of to progressive rate structure lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government economic influence in several other areas the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking act provided strong financial network in the country it also established national currency in congress created with lincoln approval the department of agriculture in lincoln sent senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota presented with execution warrants for convicted santee dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants eventually approving for execution one was later reprieved president lincoln had planned to reform federal indian policy in the wake of grant casualties in his campaign against lee lincoln had considered yet another executive call for military draft but it was never issued in response to rumors of one however the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market lincoln reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior he ordered the military to seize the two papers the seizure lasted for two days lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the thanksgiving holiday in the united states before lincoln presidency thanksgiving while regional holiday in new england since the th century had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates the last such proclamation had been during james madison presidency years before in lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be day of thanksgiving in june lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park judicial appointments supreme court appointments noah haynes swayne samuel freeman miller david davis stephen johnson field salmon portland chase chief justice salmon portland chase was lincoln choice to be chief justice of the united states lincoln declared philosophy on court nominations was that we cannot ask man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it therefore we must take man whose opinions are known lincoln made five appointments to the united states supreme court noah haynes swayne nominated january and appointed january was chosen as an anti slavery lawyer who was committed to the union samuel freeman miller nominated and appointed on july supported lincoln in the election and was an avowed abolitionist david davis lincoln campaign manager in nominated december and appointed december had also served as judge in lincoln illinois court circuit stephen johnson field previous california supreme court justice was nominated march and appointed march and provided geographic balance as well as political balance to the court as democrat finally lincoln treasury secretary salmon chase was nominated as chief justice and appointed the same day on december lincoln believed chase was an able jurist would support reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the republican party other judicial appointments lincoln appointed federal judges including four associate justices and one chief justice to the supreme court of the united states and judges to the united states district courts lincoln appointed no judges to the united states circuit courts during his time in office states admitted to the union west virginia admitted to the union june contained the former north westernmost counties of virginia that seceded from virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the union as condition for its admission west virginia constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery nevada which became the third state in the far west of the continent was admitted as free state on october assassination and funeral shown in the presidential booth of ford theatre from left to right are assassin john wilkes booth abraham lincoln mary todd lincoln clara harris and henry rathbone abraham lincoln was assassinated by john wilkes booth on good friday april while attending play at ford theatre as the american civil war was drawing to close the assassination occurred five days after the surrender of robert lee and the confederate army of northern virginia booth was well known actor and confederate spy from maryland though he never joined the confederate army he had contacts with the confederate secret service in booth formulated plan very similar to one of thomas conrad previously authorized by the confederacy to kidnap lincoln in exchange for the release of confederate prisoners after attending an april speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks an incensed booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president learning that the president and grant would be attending ford theatre booth formulated plan with co conspirators to assassinate lincoln and grant at the theater as well as vice president johnson and secretary of state seward at their homes without his main bodyguard ward hill lamon lincoln left to attend the play our american cousin on april at the last minute grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play lincoln bodyguard john parker left ford theater during intermission to drink at the saloon next door the now unguarded president sat in his state box in the balcony seizing the opportunity booth crept up from behind and at about pm aimed at the back of lincoln head and fired at point blank range mortally wounding the president major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth but booth stabbed him and escaped after being on the run for days booth was tracked down and found on farm in virginia some south of washington after refusing to surrender to union troops booth was killed by sergeant boston corbett on april doctor charles leale an army surgeon found the president unresponsive barely breathing and with no detectable pulse having determined that the president had been shot in the head and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought he made an attempt to clear the blood clot after which the president began to breathe more naturally the dying president was taken across the street to petersen house after remaining in coma for nine hours lincoln died at am on april secretary of war stanton saluted and said now he belongs to the ages lincoln flag enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the white house by bareheaded union officers while the city church bells rang president johnson was sworn in at am less than hours after lincoln death the late president lay in state in the east room and then in the capitol rotunda from april through april for his final journey with his son willie both caskets were transported in the executive coach united states and for three weeks the lincoln special funeral train decorated in black bunting bore lincoln remains on slow circuitous waypoint journey from washington to springfield illinois stopping at many cities across the north for large scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands bonfires and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom to eulogize lincoln one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow but also noted that some lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news african americans were especially moved they had lost their moses in larger sense the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended religious and philosophical beliefs abraham lincoln painting by george peter alexander healy in as young man lincoln was religious skeptic or in the words of biographer an iconoclast later in life lincoln frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been device to appeal to his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants he never joined church although he frequently attended with his wife however he was deeply familiar with the bible and he both quoted and praised it he was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others lincoln never made clear profession of christian beliefs however he did believe in an all powerful god that shaped events and by was expressing those beliefs in major speeches in the lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power in the lincoln believed in providence in general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence when he suffered the death of his son edward lincoln more frequently expressed need to depend on god the death of his son willie in february may have caused lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace after willie death lincoln considered why from divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without human contest yet the contest began and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day yet the contest proceeds on the day lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land health several claims abound that lincoln health was declining before the assassination these are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting one such claim is that he suffered from rare genetic disorder men which manifests with medullary thyroid carcinoma mucosal neuromas and marfanoid appearance others simply claim he had marfan syndrome based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers and the association of possible aortic regurgitation which can cause bobbing of the head demusset sign based on blurring of lincoln head in photographs which back then had long exposure time dna analysis was being refused by the grand army of the republic museum in philadelphia historical reputation lincoln image is carved into the stone of mount rushmore in surveys of scholars ranking presidents conducted since the lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three often as number one study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after washington in presidential ranking polls conducted in the united states since lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls generally the top three presidents are rated as lincoln george washington and franklin roosevelt although lincoln and washington and washington and roosevelt are occasionally reversed president lincoln assassination increased his status to the point of making him national martyr lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as champion for human liberty republicans linked lincoln name to their party many though not all in the south considered lincoln as man of outstanding ability historians have said he was classical liberal in the th century sense allen guelzo states that lincoln was lincoln became favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across europe and latin america and even in asia schwartz argues that lincoln american reputation grew slowly in the late th century until the progressive era when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in american history with even white southerners in agreement the high point came in with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state in the cold war years lincoln image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes by the lincoln had become hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers as whig activist lincoln was spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks internal improvements and railroads in opposition to the agrarian democrats william harris found that lincoln reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism james randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders by the late some african american intellectuals led by lerone bennett jr rejected lincoln role as the great emancipator bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln white supremacist in he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed sending freed slaves to another country defenders such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation historian barry schwartz wrote in that lincoln image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late th century on the other hand donald opined in his biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason in the st century president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using lincoln bible for his swearing in to office at both his inaugurations lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood almost always in flattering light the union nationalism as envisioned by lincoln helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and franklin delano roosevelt memory and memorials lincoln memorial in washington lincoln portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency the penny and the bill his likeness also appears on many postage stamps and he has been memorialized in many town city and county names including the capital of nebraska while he is usually portrayed bearded he first grew beard in at the suggestion of year old grace bedell the most famous and most visited memorials are lincoln sculpture on mount rushmore lincoln memorial ford theatre and petersen house where he died in washington and the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum in springfield illinois not far from lincoln home as well as his tomb there was also the great moments with mr lincoln exhibit in disneyland and hall of presidents at walt disney world which had to do with walt disney admiring lincoln ever since he was little boy barry schwartz sociologist who has examined america cultural memory argues that in the and the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life during the great depression he argues lincoln served as means for seeing the world disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful franklin roosevelt preparing america for war used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan americans asked what would lincoln do however schwartz also finds that since world war ii lincoln symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness he suggested that

aristotle aristotélēs bc was an ancient greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of stagira chalkidiki in the north of classical greece along with plato aristotle is considered the father of western philosophy which inherited almost its entire lexicon from his teachings including problems and methods of inquiry so influencing almost all forms of knowledge little is known for certain about his life his father nicomachus died when aristotle was child and he was brought up by guardian at seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined plato academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven bc his writings cover many subjects including physics biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetry theatre music rhetoric psychology linguistics politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of western philosophy shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip ii of macedon tutored alexander the great beginning in bc teaching alexander gave aristotle many opportunities he established library in the lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books which were papyrus scrolls the fact that aristotle was pupil of plato contributed to his former views of platonism but following plato death aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from platonism to empiricism he believed all concepts and knowledge were ultimately based on perception aristotle views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works aristotle views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics some of aristotle zoological observations such as on the hectocotyl reproductive arm of the octopus were disbelieved until the th century his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and john buridan aristotelianism profoundly influenced islamic thought during the middle ages as well as christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as the first teacher his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics all aspects of aristotle philosophy continue to be the object of academic study though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication only around third of his original output has survived none of it intended for publication aristotle has been depicted by major artists including raphael and rembrandt early modern theories including william harvey circulation of the blood and galileo galilei kinematics were developed in reaction to aristotle in the th century george boole gave aristotle logic mathematical foundation with his system of algebraic logic in the th century martin heidegger created new interpretation of aristotle political philosophy but elsewhere aristotle was widely criticised even ridiculed by thinkers such as the philosopher bertrand russell and the biologist peter medawar more recently aristotle has again been taken seriously such as in the thinking of ayn rand and alasdair macintyre while armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotle biology the image of aristotle tutoring the young alexander remains current as in the film alexander and the poetics continues to play role in the cinema of the united states life mieza macedonia greece in general the details of aristotle life are not well established the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on few salient points aristotle whose name means the best purpose in ancient greek was born in bc in stagira chalcidice about km miles east of modern day thessaloniki his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon aristotle was orphaned at young age and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian although little information about aristotle childhood has survived he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato academy he remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving athens in bc the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academy direction after control passed to plato nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared the anti macedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor after the death of hermias aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon while in lesbos aristotle married pythias either hermias adoptive daughter or niece she bore him daughter whom they also named pythias in bc aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander portrait bust of aristotle an imperial roman st or nd century ad copy of lost bronze sculpture made by lysippos aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon during aristotle time in the macedonian court he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and aristotle own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric in one famous example he counsels alexander to be leader to the greeks and despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants by bc aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him son whom he named after his father nicomachus according to the suda he also had an erômenos palaephatus of abydus this period in athens between and bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics on the soul and poetics aristotle studied and made significant contributions to logic metaphysics mathematics physics biology botany ethics politics agriculture medicine dance and theatre near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander relationship with persia and persians widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing role in alexander death but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death following alexander death anti macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled in bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mother family estate in chalcis on euboea at which occasion he was said to have stated will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy reference to athens trial and execution of socrates he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife abstract philosophy logic with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until th century advances in mathematical logic kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion analytics and the organon one of aristotle types of syllogism in words in terms in equations all men are mortal all greeks are men all greeks are mortal ps ms px what we today call aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism methods of logical argument aristotle himself would have labelled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotle work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into set of six books called the organon around bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers the books are categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutations the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle writings it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning the rhetoric is not conventionally included but it states that it relies on the topics epistemology plato left and aristotle in raphael fresco the school of athens aristotle holds his nicomachean ethics and gestures to the earth representing empirical observation whilst plato gestures to the heavens representing the forms and holds his timaeus like his teacher plato aristotle philosophy aims at the universal aristotle ontology places the universal katholou in particulars kath hekaston things in the world whereas for plato the universal is separately existing form which actual things imitate this means that aristotle epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world and rises to knowledge of the universal whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these for aristotle form is still what phenomena are based on but is instantiated in particular substance aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction whereas plato relies on deduction from priori principles in aristotle terminology natural philosophy is branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences aristotle work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science note however that his use of the term science carries different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics his practical science includes ethics and politics his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry his theoretical science covers physics mathematics and metaphysics metaphysics aristotle defines metaphysics as the knowledge of immaterial being or of being in the highest degree of abstraction he refers to metaphysics as first philosophy as well as the theologic science substance potentiality and actuality aristotle examines the concepts of substance ousia and essence to ti ên einai the what it was to be in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that particular substance is combination of both matter and form philosophical theory called hylomorphism in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed for example the matter of house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia that let us define something as house the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption he distinguishes the coming to be from growth and diminution which is change in quantity locomotion which is change in space and alteration which is change in quality the potential made actual by learning the coming to be is change where nothing persists of which the resultant is property in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form referring to potentiality this is what thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else for example the seed of plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if is not prevented by something it will become plant potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise acting actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when plant does one of the activities that plants do for that for the sake of which to hou heneka thing is is its principle and the becoming is for the sake of the end and the actuality is the end and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired for animals do not see in order that they may have sight but they have sight that they may see in summary the matter used to make house has potentiality to be house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also final cause or end then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality with this definition of the particular substance matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man unity however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same universals and particulars plato forms exist as universals like the ideal form of an apple for aristotle both matter and form belong to the individual thing hylomorphism plato argued that all things have universal form which could be either property or relation to other things when we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyse form of an apple in this distinction there is particular apple and universal form of an apple moreover we can place an apple next to book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not part of particular things for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still proper universal form aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals where plato spoke of the world of forms place where all universal forms subsist aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms natural philosophy aristotle natural philosophy spans wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics biology and other natural sciences physics the four classical elements fire air water earth of empedocles and aristotle illustrated with burning log the log releases all four elements as it is destroyed five elements in his on generation and corruption aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by empedocles earth water air and fire to two of the four sensible qualities hot cold wet and dry in the empedoclean scheme all matter was made of the four elements in differing proportions aristotle scheme added the heavenly aether the divine substance of the heavenly spheres stars and planets aristotle elements element motion modern stateof matter earth down solid water down liquid air up gas fire up plasma aether divinesubstance circular in heavens motion aristotle physics of moving bodies is either overlooked in philosophical accounts or dismissed as intuitive grossly erroneous or not even science for example it is stated that john philoponus and galileo showed by experiment that aristotle claim that heavier object falls faster than lighter object is incorrect however the physicist carlo rovelli argues that this is profoundly misleading since aristotle physics of motion is based on observation is and correct within its domain of validity aristotle describes violent or unnatural motion such as that of thrown stone in the physics and natural motion such as of falling object in on the heavens in violent motion as soon as the agent stops causing it the motion stops also natural motion depends on the element concerned the aether naturally moves in circle around the heavens while the empedoclean elements move vertically up like fire as is observed or down like earth towards their natural resting places physics he states that objects fall at speed proportional to their weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid they are immersed in this is correct approximation for objects in earth gravitational field moving in air or water in the physics aristotle effectively states quantitative law that the speed of falling body is proportional say with constant to its weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid in which it is falling though he implies that in vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite and concludes from this apparent absurdity that vacuum is not possible the law is highly nontrivial and correct approximation of newtonian physics for objects in the earth gravitational field immersed in fluid such as air or water as everything in daily life is in this system aristotle was correct to state that heavy bodies in steady fall travel faster than light ones whether friction is ignored or not and that they fall more slowly in denser medium philoponus and galileo correctly objected that for the transient phase still increasing in speed with heavy objects falling short distance the law does not apply galileo used balls on short incline to show this rovelli notes that two heavy balls with the same shape and different weight do fall at different speeds from an aeroplane confirming aristotle theory not galileo for heavenly bodies like the sun moon and stars the observed motions are to very good approximation circular around the earth centre for example the apparent rotation of the sky because of the rotation of the earth and the rotation of the moon around the earth as aristotle stated rovelli notes that archimedes corrected aristotle theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places metal boats can float if they displace enough water floating depends in archimedes scheme on the mass and volume of the object not as aristotle thought its elementary composition rovelli notes too that newton forced motion corresponds to aristotle violent motion with its external agent but that aristotle assumption that the agent effect stops immediately it stops acting the ball leaves the thrower hand has awkward consequences he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it resulting in the medieval theory of impetus four causes aristotle argued by analogy with woodwork that thing takes its form from four causes the wood used material cause its design formal cause the tools and techniques used efficient cause and its decorative or practical purpose final cause aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors his term aitia is traditionally translated as cause but it does not always refer to temporal sequence it might be better translated as explanation but the traditional rendering will be employed here material cause describes the material out of which something is composed thus the material cause of table is wood it is not about action it does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino the formal cause is its form the arrangement of that matter it tells us what thing is that thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole macrostructure is the cause of its parts relationship known as the whole part causation plainly put the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist architect or engineer to create drawing the efficient cause is the primary source or that from which the change under consideration proceeds it identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs in the case of two dominoes when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over in the case of animals this agency is combination of how it develops from the egg and how its body functions the final cause telos is its purpose the reason why thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities the final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve this covers modern ideas of motivating causes such as volition in the case of living things it implies adaptation to particular way of life optics aristotle describes experiments in optics using camera obscura in problems book the apparatus consisted of dark chamber with small aperture that let light in with it he saw that whatever shape he made the hole the sun image always remained circular he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image chance and spontaneity according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things from what is spontaneous there is also more specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that only applies to people moral choices astronomy in astronomy aristotle refuted democritus claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun rays pointing out correctly that if the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them aristotle noted that the ground level of the aeolian islands changed before volcanic eruption geology aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations he stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one person lifetime the geologist charles lyell noted that aristotle described such change including lakes that had dried up and deserts that had become watered by rivers giving as examples the growth of the nile delta since the time of homer and the upheaving of one of the aeolian islands previous to volcanic eruption biology hectocotyl arm of the octopus bottom left empirical research aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically and biology forms large part of his writings he spent two years observing and describing the zoology of lesbos and the surrounding seas including in particular the pyrrha lagoon in the centre of lesbos his data in history of animals generation of animals movement of animals and parts of animals are assembled from his own observations statements given by people with specialised knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas his apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is historical accident his works on botany have been lost but two books on plants by his pupil theophrastus have survived aristotle reports on the sea life visible from observation on lesbos and the catches of fishermen he describes the catfish electric ray and frogfish in detail as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus his description of the hectocotyl arm used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until the th century he gives accurate descriptions of the four chambered fore stomachs of ruminants and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark he notes that an animal structure is well matched to function so among birds the heron which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish has long neck and long legs and sharp spear like beak whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet darwin too noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal but unlike aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution aristotle writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution but while aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridisations could occur he saw these as rare accidents for aristotle accidents like heat waves in winter must be considered distinct from natural causes he was thus critical of empedocles materialist theory of survival of the fittest origin of living things and their organs and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results to put his views into modern terms he nowhere says that different species can have common ancestor or that one kind can change into another or that kinds can become extinct scientific style aristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals including that brood size decreases with body mass whereas gestation period increases he was correct in these predictions at least for mammals data are shown for mouse and elephant aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense he used the ancient greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations or at most investigative procedures like dissection in generation of animals he finds fertilised hen egg of suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo heart inside instead he practised different style of science systematically gathering data discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals and inferring possible causal explanations from these this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in new field such as genomics it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs narrative explanation of what is observed in this sense aristotle biology is scientific from the data he collected and documented aristotle inferred quite number of rules relating the life history features of the live bearing tetrapods terrestrial placental mammals that he studied among these correct predictions are the following brood size decreases with adult body mass so that an elephant has fewer young usually just one per brood than mouse lifespan increases with gestation period and also with body mass so that elephants live longer than mice have longer period of gestation and are heavier as final example fecundity decreases with lifespan so long lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short lived kinds like mice classification of living things aristotle recorded that the embryo of dogfish was attached by cord to kind of placenta the yolk sac like higher animal this formed an exception to the linear scale from highest to lowest aristotle distinguished about species of animals arranging these in the history of animals in graded scale of perfection scala naturae with man at the top his system had eleven grades of animal from highest potential to lowest expressed in their form at birth the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures the lowest laid cold dry mineral like eggs animals came above plants and these in turn were above minerals he grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter animals with blood and below them the colder invertebrates as animals without blood those with blood were divided into the live bearing mammals and the egg laying birds reptiles fish those without blood were insects crustacea non shelled cephalopods and shelled and the hard shelled molluscs bivalves and gastropods he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into linear scale and noted various exceptions such as that sharks had placenta like the tetrapods to modern biologist the explanation not available to aristotle is convergent evolution he believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design aristotle scala naturae highest to lowest group examples given by aristotle blood legs souls rational sensitive vegetative qualities man man with blood legs live bearing tetrapods cat hare with blood legs cetaceans dolphin whale with blood none birds bee eater nightjar with blood legs except eggs egg laying tetrapods chameleon crocodile with blood legs except scales eggs snakes water snake ottoman viper with blood none except scales eggs egg laying fishes sea bass parrotfish with blood none including eggs among the egg laying fishes placental selachians shark skate with blood none but placenta like tetrapods crustaceans shrimp crab without many legs except shell cephalopods squid octopus without tentacles hard shelled animals cockle trumpet snail without none mineral shell larva bearing insects ant cicada without legs spontaneously generating sponges worms without none or from earth plants fig without none minerals iron without none none psychology soul structure for souls of plants animals and humans making humans unique in having all three types of soul aristotle psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psyche posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul humans have rational soul the human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous intellect and logos reason for aristotle the soul is the form of living being because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians he placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain notable is aristotle division of sensation and thought which generally went against previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon memory according to aristotle in on the soul memory is the ability to hold perceived experience in your mind and to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past in other words memory is mental picture phantasm that can be recovered aristotle believed an impression is left on semi fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make memory memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation aristotelian common sense and thinking aristotle uses the term memory for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at particular time and processing specific contents memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences both for our previous experience and present experience because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences to search for these impressions people search the memory itself within the memory if one experience is offered instead of specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the next when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed recollection is thus the self directed activity of retrieving the information stored in memory impression only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity such as numbers and words animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed seat of perception linked by his laws of association similarity contrast and contiguity aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain impressions was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity contrast and contiguity described in his laws of association aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience according to aristotle association is the power innate in mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled dreams aristotle describes sleep in on sleep and wakefulness sleep takes place as result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body while person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness since person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire which is the result of sensation however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently unless they are weary dreams do not involve actually sensing stimulus in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner aristotle explains that when person stares at moving stimulus such as the waves in body of water and then look away the next thing they look at appears to have wavelike motion when person perceives stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored however during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences so dreams result from these lasting impressions since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience during sleep person is in an altered state of mind aristotle compares sleeping person to person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward stimulus for example person who has strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings since person sleeping is in suggestible state and unable to make judgements they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams like the infatuated person this leads the person to believe the dream is real even when the dreams are absurd in nature one component of aristotle theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by divine being aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences aristotle claimed that dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it if person had an image appear for moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered dream because they were awake when it occurred secondly any sensory experience that is perceived while person is asleep does not qualify as part of dream for example if while person is sleeping door shuts and in their dream they hear door is shut this sensory experience is not part of the dream lastly the images of dreams must be result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences practical philosophy aristotle practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics politics and rhetoric virtues and their accompanying vices too little virtuous mean too much humbleness high mindedness vainglory lack of purpose right ambition over ambition spiritlessness good temper irascibility rudeness civility obsequiousness cowardice courage rashness insensibility self control intemperance sarcasm sincerity boastfulness boorishness wit buffoonery shamelessness modesty shyness callousness just resentment spitefulness pettiness generosity vulgarity meanness liberality wastefulness ethics aristotle considered ethics to be practical rather than theoretical study one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of thing an eye is only good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight aristotle reasoned that humans must have function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē soul in accordance with reason logos aristotle identified such an optimum activity the virtuous mean between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires good character ēthikē aretē often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence aristotle taught that to achieve virtuous and potentially happy character requires first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words philosopher politics in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics aristotle considered the city to be natural community moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part he also famously stated that man is by nature political animal and also arguing that humanity defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like machine and as collection of parts none of which can exist without the others aristotle conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner aristotle classifications of political constitutions the common modern understanding of political community as modern state is quite different from aristotle understanding although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as political community or partnership koinōnia the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences in protrepticus the character aristotle states rhetoric and poetics the blind oedipus commending his children to the gods by bénigne gagneraux in his poetics aristotle uses the tragedy oedipus tyrannus by sophocles as an example of how the perfect tragedy should be structured with generally good protagonist who starts the play prosperous but loses everything through some hamartia fault aristotle rhetoric proposes that speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience ethos an appeal to the speaker character pathos an appeal to the audience emotion and logos an appeal to logical reasoning he also categorises rhetoric into three genres epideictic ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame forensic judicial speeches over guilt or innocence and deliberative speeches calling on an audience to make decision on an issue aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs enthymeme proof by syllogism and paradeigma proof by example aristotle writes in his poetics that epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry painting sculpture music and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis imitation each varying in imitation by medium object and manner he applies the term mimesis both as property of work of art and also as the product of the artist intention and contends that the audience realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself aristotle states that mimesis is natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry follows the pattern of nature because of this aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what stephen halliwell calls highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama while it is believed that aristotle poetics originally comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry the characters in tragedy are merely means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions aristotle concludes poetics with discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic aristotle was keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop views on women aristotle analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element on this ground proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism however aristotle gave equal weight to women happiness as he did to men and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men influence more than years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method taneli kukkonen writing in the classical tradition observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched and his reach in influencing every branch of intellectual enterprise including western ethical and political theory theology rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long as result kukkonen argues any analysis of reality today will almost certainly carry aristotelian overtones evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind jonathan barnes wrote that an account of aristotle intellectual afterlife would be little less than history of european thought on his successor theophrastus frontispiece to version of theophrastus historia plantarum originally written around bc aristotle pupil and successor theophrastus wrote the history of plants pioneering work in botany some of his technical terms remain in use such as carpel from carpos fruit and pericarp from pericarpion seed chamber theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than aristotle was instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned on later greek philosophers the immediate influence of aristotle work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school aristotle notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus aristotle influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter bringing with him on his expedition host of zoologists botanists and researchers he had also learned great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall surpass other men if those doctrines wherein have been trained are to be all men common property on hellenistic science after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work though interest in aristotle ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not though few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the th and th centuries ernst mayr states that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance on byzantine scholars greek christian scribes played crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century philoponus stands out for having attempted fundamental critique of aristotle views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought after hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena on the medieval islamic world islamic portrayal of aristotle aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers alkindus considered aristotle the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars and was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy in accordance with the greek theorists the muslims considered aristotle to be dogmatic philosopher the author of closed system and believed that aristotle shared with plato essential tenets of thought some went so far as to credit aristotle himself with neo platonic metaphysical ideas on medieval europe aristotle ridden by phyllis by hans baldung with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from ad to except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after the scholastic thomas aquinas wrote his summa theologica working from moerbeke translations and calling aristotle the philosopher the demand for aristotle writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages scholars such as boethius peter abelard and john buridan worked on aristotelian logic the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having at his beddes heed twenty bookes clad in blak or reed of aristotle and his philosophie cautionary medieval tale held that aristotle advised his pupil alexander to avoid the king seductive mistress phyllis but was himself captivated by her and allowed her to ride him phyllis had secretly told alexander what to expect and he witnessed phyllis proving that woman charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher male intellect artists such as hans baldung produced series of illustrations of the popular theme the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the divine comedy dante inferno canto iv translation hell vidi maestro di color che sanno seder tra filosofica famiglia tutti lo miran tutti onor li fanno quivi vid ïo socrate platone che nnanzi li altri più presso li stanno saw the master there of those who know amid the philosophic family by all admired and by all reverenced there plato too saw and socrates who stood beside him closer than the rest on early modern scientists william harvey exercitatio anatomica de motu cordis et sanguinis in animalibus showed that the blood circulated contrary to classical era thinking in the early modern period scientists such as william harvey in england and galileo galilei in italy reacted against the theories of aristotle and other classical era thinkers like galen establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood establishing that the heart functioned as pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body heat as aristotle thought galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace aristotle physics proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight on th century thinkers the th century german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle aristotle rigidly separated action from production and argued for the deserved subservience of some people natural slaves and the natural superiority virtue arete of others it was martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition the english mathematician george boole fully accepted aristotle logic but decided to go under over and beyond it with his system of algebraic logic in his book the laws of thought this gives logic mathematical foundation with equations enables it to solve equations as well as check validity and allows it to handle wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms not just two modern rejection and rehabilitation that most enduring of romantic images aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander illustration by during the th century aristotle work was widely criticised the philosopher bertrand russell argued that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine russell also refers to aristotle ethics as repulsive and called his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors in the biologist peter medawar could still state in pure seventeenth century tones that aristotle had assembled strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay imperfect observation wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility by the start of the st century however aristotle was taken more seriously kukkonen noted that in the best th century scholarship aristotle comes alive as thinker wrestling with the full weight of the greek philosophical tradition ayn rand accredited aristotle as the greatest philosopher in history and cited him as major influence on her thinking more recently alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in way that is anti elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans kukkonen observed too that that most enduring of romantic images aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander remained current as in the film alexander while the firm rules of aristotle theory of drama have ensured role for the poetics in hollywood biologists continue to be interested in aristotle thinking armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotle biology while niko tinbergen four questions based on aristotle four causes are used to analyse animal behaviour they examine function phylogeny mechanism and ontogeny surviving works corpus aristotelicum first page of edition of the nicomachean ethics in greek and latin the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum these texts as opposed to aristotle lost works are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotle school reference to them is made according to the organisation of immanuel bekker royal prussian academy edition aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica berlin which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works loss and preservation aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls the common writing medium of that era his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric intended for the public and the esoteric for use within the lyceum school aristotle lost works stray considerably in from the surviving aristotelian corpus whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an view to subsequent publication the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication cicero description of aristotle literary style as river of gold must have applied to the published works not the surviving notes major question in the history of aristotle works is how the exoteric writings were all lost and how the ones we now possess came to us the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today legacy depictions of aristotle aristotle has been depicted by

gershwin had spent in paris it evokes the sights and energy of the french capital in the and is one of his best known compositions gershwin composed an american in paris on commission from the conductor walter damrosch he scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophones and automobile horns he brought back some parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition which took place on december in carnegie hall with damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic gershwin completed the orchestration on november less than four weeks before the work premiere gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer deems taylor noting that my purpose here is to portray the impression of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere when the tone poem moves into the blues our american friend has succumbed to spasm of homesickness but nostalgia is not fatal disease the american visitor once again is an alert spectator of parisian life and the street noises and french atmosphere are triumphant background gershwin was attracted by maurice ravel unusual chords upon gershwin request ravel accepted him as student and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in ready to study after his initial student audition with ravel turned into sharing of musical theories ravel said he couldn teach him but he would send letter referring him to nadia boulanger while the studies were cut short that trip resulted in the initial version of an american in paris written as thank you note to gershwin hosts robert and mabel shirmer gershwin called it rhapsodic ballet it is written freely and in much more modern idiom than his prior works gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for tour to this end upon his return to new york gershwin joined the efforts of ravel friend robert schmitz pianist ravel had met during the war to urge ravel to tour the schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting franco american musical relations and was able to offer ravel fee for the tour an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel gershwin greeted ravel in new york in february at the start of ravel tour and joined ravel again later in the tour in los angeles after lunch together with chaplin in beverly hills ravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled house concert in friend music salon performing among kindred spirits ravel tour reignited gershwin desire to return to paris which he did in march ravel high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris yet after playing for her she told him she could not teach him nadia boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students don copy others be yourself in this case why try to be second rate ravel when you are already first rate gershwin this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete new work based on paris and perhaps second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound yeats ernest hemingway and artist pablo picasso composition gershwin based an american in paris on melodic fragment called very parisienne written in on his first visit to paris as gift to his hosts robert and mabel schirmer he described the piece as rhapsodic ballet because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works gershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere the piece is structured into five sections which culminate in loose aba format gershwin first episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops third theme in the subito con brio the style of this section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six this section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe english horn and taxi horns the section andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in faster twelve bar blues in the section gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum moderato con grazia is the last section that returns to the themes set in after recapitulating the walking themes gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section in the final grandioso instrumentation an american in paris is scored for flutes rd doubling on piccolo oboes english horn clarinets in flat bass clarinet in flat bassoons horns in trumpets in flat trombones tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block cymbals low and high tom toms xylophone glockenspiel celesta taxi horns labeled as and with circles around them alto saxophone soprano saxophone tenor saxophone soprano saxophone alto saxophone baritone saxophone soprano saxophone alto saxophone and strings although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes and it has recently come to light that gershwin intention was to have used the notes and it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as and with circles he may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played the revised edition by campbell watson calls for three saxophones alto tenor and baritone in this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments in gershwin specialist jack gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of an american in paris working directly from gershwin original manuscript including the restoration of gershwin soprano saxophone parts removed in campbell watson revision gibbons restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at london queen elizabeth hall on july by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian william daly arranged the score for piano solo which was published by new world music in response gershwin did not particularly like walter damrosch interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris he stated that damrosch sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during matinee performance of this work the audience according to edward cushing responded with demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than his lukewarm concerto in some did not think it belonged in program with classical composers césar franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere gershwin responded to the critics it not beethoven symphony you know it humorous piece nothing solemn about it it not intended to draw tears if it pleases symphony audiences as light jolly piece series of impressions musically expressed it succeeds preservation status on september it was announced that musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score will be eventually released the gershwin family working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan are working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwin true intent it is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster bar blues section or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during gershwin composition process the score to an american in paris is currently scheduled to be issued first in series of scores to be released the entire project may take to years to complete but an american in paris will be an early volume in the series two urtext editions of the work have been published by the german publisher note music in the changes made by campbell watson have been withdrawn in both editions in the extended urtext bars of music have been re integrated conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance recordings first recording an american in paris has been frequently recorded the first recording was made for rca victor in with nathaniel shilkret conducting the rca victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio then little later shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes flat flat higher and lower the radio broadcast of the september hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert in which an american in paris also conducted by shilkret was second on the program
